Are rating-based performance awards subject to the $10,000 and $25,000 approval thresholds?

Yes. Under statute and the implementing regulations, such awards are subject to the OPM and Presidential approval, respectively. The two exceptions are the Department of Defense and the Internal Revenue Service who are authorized to grant awards up to $25,000 without OPM/Presidential approval.

Time-Off Awards
Can a manager offer an employee the choice between a Time-off award and another type of award?

OPM strongly discourages this. Giving employees the choice between different types of awards could have tax consequences.

Can a Time-off award be transferred if the employee leaves one department and accepts a position with another department?

If an employee transfers from one department to another, the gaining department is not obligated to honor the Time-off award. Therefore, any unused Time-off awards are not transferable, unless a special arrangement is made with the receiving department to honor the Time-off award granted by the employee's former department. Also, the losing department may not convert the Time-off to cash and give that cash to the employee.

Why does OPM prohibit converting Time-off awards to cash?

The "currency" of a Time-off award is time, not money. Departments have the authority to grant cash awards when they feel that is the appropriate form of recognition or incentive.

Can a manager substitute Time-off awards for compensatory time?

No. The circumstances appropriate for the use of compensatory time are not generally appropriate for a Time-off award. Compensatory time is authorized in exchange for hours worked in excess of the employee's regular work schedule. Awarding time off instead of compensatory time violates the incentive awards concept of recognizing exceptional performance, as opposed to compensating for extended work schedules.

The Performance Appraisal
What's the difference between an appraisal system and an appraisal program?

An appraisal system describes the general policies and parameters for the administration of performance appraisal programs in the department. An appraisal program is the specific procedures, methods, and requirements for planning, monitoring, and rating performance. Programs have to be designed within the boundaries of the system but can be tailored to the needs of the organization.

How long does my supervisor have to be in his/her position before he/she can rate me?

Government-wide regulations do not specify a minimum amount of time a supervisor must be on the job before he/she may rate an employee. Any department’s performance appraisal programs may require a minimum amount of time the supervisor must be on the job before rating an employee. The Department places no minimum time required in a position before a supervisor can rate an employee.

Can a program include more than one pattern of summary levels for ratings of record?

No. Each program must use a single pattern of summary levels. To use different summary patterns, departments must define separate programs and employee coverage to which a single pattern applies. However, more than one program can use the same summary pattern.

Who has the authority to assign a rating of record to an employee?

Government-wide performance management regulations do not specifically designate who has the authority to assign a rating of record. The department will determine who has this authority.

Generally, the Department devolves this duty to the rating official, or if he/she is unavailable, to the reviewing official.

Can a department develop more than one appraisal program?

Yes. A department can authorize the development of separate appraisal programs under the framework of their appraisal system. This allows departmental sub-components or sub-populations to determine how best to address their needs and cultures and more effectively manage individual and organizational performance by tailoring specific appraisal procedures and requirements to mission and work technology.

Can a rating of record ever be given at a time other than the end of the appraisal period?

Yes. Government-wide regulations define a rating of record as the performance rating completed at the end of the appraisal period that reflects performance over the entire period, or an off-cycle rating of record given when a WGI decision must be prepared. These are the only times that a rating of record can be issued.

Does an employee have to have a performance rating or a rating of record of Achieved Unsatisfactory Results before a performance-based action can be taken?

No. Both a performance rating and a rating of record involve the evaluation of an employee's performance against all the elements and standards in the performance plan. At any time during the appraisal period, a department can make the determination that an employee's performance is unacceptable on one or more critical elements. This determination is sufficient to begin the process that could lead to a performance-based action, including termination, if the employee's performance fails to improve to an acceptable level.

Does OPM have to review and approve all of a department’s appraisal programs?

OPM must review and approve a department’s appraisal system which sets out the limits within which all the department’s programs must be developed. OPM must approve the appraisal system before any appraisal program developed under the system can be implemented.
