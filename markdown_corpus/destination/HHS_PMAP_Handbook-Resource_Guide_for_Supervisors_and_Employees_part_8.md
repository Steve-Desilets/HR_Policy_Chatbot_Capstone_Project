Employees whose performance is Achieved More than Expected Results may be eligible for a performance award of up to four (4) percent of salary. Employees whose performance is Achieved Expected Results may be eligible for a performance award of up to three (3) percent of salary. The locality payment or special rate supplement, apply to both the Achieved More than Expected Results and Achieved Expected Results performance ratings. All awards are at the discretion of management and subject to funds availability. According to OPM, no employee is entitled to an award.

Employees who receive Partially Achieved Expected Results or Achieved Unsatisfactory Results ratings are not eligible for performance rating-based awards.

OpDivs/StaffDivs may also recognize employees for short-term accomplishments using other award types, such as Special Act/Special Service awards and Time-Off awards, as appropriate. Refer to the awards section of this handbook.

Addressing Poor Performance
At any time in the performance appraisal cycle that an employee’s performance is not meeting performance expectations, the supervisor must take prompt and appropriate actions to improve the performance. The supervisor will provide feedback to inform the employee regarding falling below the Achieved Expected Results (AE) level prior to contacting Labor and Employee Relations (LER) or any other management official. After meeting with the employee, the supervisor may contact the LER office for advice and assistance. The LER office is available to provide guidance to rating officials for documenting performance, providing feedback to the employee, and assessing additional appropriate courses of action.

Partially Achieved Expected Results Level
An employee who is performing at the Partially Achieved Expected Results level cannot be granted a WGI or a non-competitive promotion to a higher grade in a career ladder. Even if a WGI is not due, when an employee is performing at the Partially Achieved Expected Results level, the supervisor must advise the employee of his/her specific performance deficiencies and take appropriate steps to assist the employee in correcting those deficiencies. An official Opportunity to Demonstrate Acceptable Performance (ODAP) is not required to deal with Partially Achieved Expected Results performance. It is used to deal with performance at the Achieved Unsatisfactory Results level, as described below.

Achieved Unsatisfactory Results Level
If performance on any critical element is determined to be at the Achieved Unsatisfactory Results level at any time during the rating period, the supervisor will provide assistance to help the employee improve performance to the minimally acceptable level of Partially Achieved Expected Results, or better. The supervisor must, at a minimum, give written notice to the employee of his/her failure to demonstrate acceptable performance and provide the employee an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance under an ODAP. The written notification must include:

The specific elements on which the employee’s performance is determined to be Achieved Unsatisfactory Results, including specific examples of how the employee’s performance is unsatisfactory.
The performance requirements that must be met.
The specific assistance that will be provided and the meeting schedule for feedback, assistance, and coaching that will be established to help the employee improve performance.
The specific period of time the employee will be given to demonstrate acceptable performance.
Notification that actions may be initiated to reassign, reduce in grade, or remove the employee if performance does not improve to at least the Partially Achieved Expected Results level.
The employee must be given a reasonable period of time in which to demonstrate a Partially Achieved Expected Results level of performance. The length of this reasonable opportunity period is not dictated by regulation nor Departmental guidance. The reasonable period of time to improve will be determined by management and may vary based on the requirements of the individual position and the amount of time and effort previously devoted to correcting the employee’s performance deficiencies. As a general rule, less time and effort are required in cases where the rating official has properly and promptly managed performance and documented his/her efforts to resolve performance problems. For bargaining unit employees, additional Collective Bargaining Agreement requirements may apply. An employee who fails to improve under an ODAP may be removed from federal service.

Supervisors must promptly contact and consult with the LER office for assistance in dealing with unacceptable performance and/or employee misconduct concerns.
