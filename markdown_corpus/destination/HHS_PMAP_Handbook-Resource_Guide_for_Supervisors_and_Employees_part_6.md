When providing feedback, the following concepts are important:

Feedback works best when it relates to a specific goal, such as those established in the employee’s performance plan. Basing feedback on the employee’s performance against the elements and standards is critical to providing tangible, objective, and powerful feedback. Telling an employee that he/she is doing well because she exceeded her goal by ten (10) percent, for example, is more effective than simply saying “you're doing a good job.”
Employees should receive information about how they are doing in as timely a fashion as possible. If performance improvement is required, the sooner the employee is advised of the deficiency, the sooner he/she can take steps to correct the problem. Conversely, if a goal has been exceeded, the sooner the employee receives positive feedback, the greater the impact and sense of appreciation for the achievement.
Feedback should be provided in a manner that will best help performance. This is not to say that feedback should be exaggerated or under-stated. On the contrary, feedback should be accurate, factual, and complete to most effectively reinforce what the employee has   done well, and what the employee needs to do to improve his/her performance.
Midyear Review
An important part of the performance management process is ensuring that each employee receives at least one formal progress review during each appraisal period; approximately midway through the rating cycle. Formal ratings are not assigned for progress reviews, nor is a written narrative required unless performance is below the Achieved Expected Results level. Completion of the progress review is acknowledged on the employee’s performance plan with signatures from both the rating official and the employee. While only one progress review is required, rating officials are encouraged to frequently discuss performance with subordinate employees during the appraisal period. This is particularly critical in the case of an employee who is not performing at the Achieved Expected Results level. In this case, it may be advisable to establish regular feedback sessions with the employee.

Topics which may be discussed in a performance review include:

Communication with internal and external customers and constituents.
Training requirements and opportunities for development.
Perceptions of work (challenging, fulfilling).
Getting/giving regular, sufficient, and specific feedback.
Any further support the employee may need.
Rating officials should document employee performance, both good and when improvement is needed, throughout the year. Rating officials should provide specific examples to the employee during progress reviews, during the rating of record, and at other appropriate times throughout the year.

Developing Employees
The process of performance management provides an excellent opportunity to identify developmental needs. During planning and monitoring of work, deficiencies in performance become evident and can be addressed. Areas for improving good performance also stand out, and action can be taken to help successful employees improve even further.

Developing employees is more than just training employees. Developing employees covers all efforts to foster learning, which happens on the job every day.  When organizations focus on developing their employees' capacity to perform, rather than just training them, employees will be able to adapt to a variety of situations which is vital for the achievement of individuals and the organization.



Formal Employee Development
Employee development can be either formal or informal. Formal development may include:

Traditional training in structured courses, classrooms, and formal development programs.
Details provide valuable experience for growth and additional skill sets.
Self-study courses including those using computer-based platforms.
A means of identifying formal training for an employee is by establishing an Individual Development Plan (IDP) through an approach of: (1) Assessment; (2) Discussion; and (3) Implementation, as follows:

Assessment: The employee reviews prior job experience, training, education, and other developmental experiences to provide concrete information regarding current strengths and skills. This could include a review of past applications for employment and past training records. The employee reviews the standards for work performance to determine core competencies necessary for the job and past performance evaluations for indications of areas needing improvement and identifies core skills specific to that need. The employee assesses personal career goals and determines immediate and long-term steps toward achieving the goals. The employee identifies specific opportunities for developmental experiences and researches possible sources for development. The employee may seek out career counseling from a variety of sources including peers, current and past supervisors, and the Human Resources staff. The supervisor is available for clarification and counseling.
Discussions: To obtain mutual commitment between the supervisor and the employee, open discussion is necessary. The employee and supervisor should mutually agree to discuss the results of the assessment and the draft IDP prepared by the employee. The discussion includes perspectives on organizational needs, job requirements, the employee’s strengths and developmental needs, financial limitations, timing, and learning opportunities that the supervisor will actively support. The supervisor coaches the employee by giving open and constructive feedback, identifying challenging assignments, discussing career paths in the organization, and reasonable timeframes for meeting the objectives of the IDP. The supervisor and employee should sign a completed IDP based on mutual agreement or final decisions of the supervisor.
Implementation: The employee ensures that any necessary procurement or training request forms are prepared and monitors work that is assigned to best accomplish the IDP’s developmental experiences. The employee reports on completion of items in the IDP. The supervisor and the employee meet periodically throughout the year to review and update the IDP. OpDivs/StaffDivs may require the use of an IDP at their discretion. Supervisors and employees should check with their Human Resources Office for the IDP or other appropriate forms to be used for documenting employee development needs.
Informal Employee Development
While managers have a large influence over formal training, they have even greater impact on creating a climate for informal employee development, which can take a wide variety of forms, some of which are listed below:

Feedback is a natural part of the monitoring process of performance management, but specific and timely feedback to employees about their performance against established expectations also provides the foundation for discussing developmental needs.
Job rotations and special assignments can stretch and challenge employees and broaden their understanding of the organization.
Coaching and counseling provides individualized advice and instruction.
Mentoring helps employees clarify career goals, understand the organization, analyze strengths and developmental needs, build support networks, and deal with roadblocks.
Using the manager as an informal teacher acknowledges that managers consciously teach employees through their own model, habits, and system of values.
Learning teams can form to meet regularly to focus on improving performance.
Although informal developmental strategies cost very little, they have potentially big payoffs in terms of improved individual and team performance.

Rating Employees
Roles of the Rating Official
Rating employees means evaluating employee performance against the elements and standards in an employee's performance plan and assigning a rating of record. Rating officials should compile performance data from all appropriate sources as a part of the rating process. It also is a good idea to ask employees to track their own progress using data identified during the planning phase so they can provide a complete account of their accomplishments during progress reviews and as part of the final rating process.  The rating official, as appropriate, also should consult customers and colleagues, review the employee’s self-assessment and other relevant performance documentation (e.g., production reports), and available feedback to ensure he/she has a complete picture of the employee’s performance for the entire performance period. The assigned rating reflects the level of the employee’s performance as assessed against the standards established in the performance plan. If an employee does not have an opportunity to perform a critical element during the rating period, no rating will be assigned and the words “Not Rated” should be written on the performance plan for that element.
