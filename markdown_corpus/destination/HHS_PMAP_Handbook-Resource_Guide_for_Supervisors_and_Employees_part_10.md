Employee’s Checklist for Appraisals
Meeting with your supervisor for a midyear review to discuss how you are doing can be very beneficial. Meeting with your supervisor to discuss your performance is beneficial for both of you, enabling you both to understand each other better. The more you know one another, the greater the likelihood you will be able to effectively communicate on an ongoing basis, particularly should a problem arise. Examples of these benefits are listed below.

Advantages of a Midyear Review to the Employee
The opportunity to obtain information directly from your supervisor about your performance expectations and standards and to clarify, if there are questions, what is required to accomplish noteworthy results.
Direct performance feedback.
Discussing the “big picture” about how you are doing overall and how the work you do helps accomplish important goals of the organization.
The opportunity to provide feedback to your supervisor about your work experience; for example, do you enjoy the work you do, are you ready for greater responsibilities (and how), are there concerns about current work assignments, or do you need more guidance and assistance from your supervisor or your co-workers.
Professional development plans and opportunities; i.e., your career goals. Career discussions can be as simple as discussing your interest in a training course to better handle a specific project, to something as broad as your career aspirations and how you plan to get there.
Employee Preparation for the Midyear Review
Although your supervisor may schedule your midyear review meeting, you are a critical participant in the discussion. In fact, you can and should identify your goals for the midyear review; for example, suggestions for providing better customer service or specific feedback or coaching on a particular skill area. In preparation for your midyear review, consider the following:

Prepare a list of key work accomplishments. Providing this list to your supervisor will ensure that your significant accomplishments are not overlooked. In addition, you are prepared to ask your supervisor for feedback on specific projects or assignments.
If you have specific issues to discuss with your supervisor, give him/her a “heads up” so that he/she can also be well-prepared for your discussion. Be prepared to discuss each issue specifically, clearly, and concisely.
What is most important for you to learn and/or find out about how you are doing?  What did you do particularly well? What are the ways you may have been disappointed or challenged in how you performed?
What feedback would you like to offer your supervisor? Be specific. For example: “I really like it when you review and edit my drafts before they are put in final form, so that we do not waste time revising documents at the last minute; or, “I really need to hear from you periodically about how I am doing when I am working on a project, rather than assuming your silence means I am doing fine.”
Where do you see your career heading? Do you have the skills you feel you need to do your job well? What skills might you want to work on better developing? How can your supervisor help you achieve your career goals?
Employee Preparation for the End-of-Year Review
Your end-of-year rating feedback discussion also can benefit you. To make the most out of this discussion, prepare and submit to your supervisor, in advance, a written self- assessment of your contributions, opportunities, and professional development.  In addition, prepare written notes of key or important points you wish to discuss. Your self- assessment should address the following areas:
Your specific major accomplishments, aligned to your performance plan.
The factors that contributed to your success throughout the year.
How well you met your day-to-day responsibilities; for example:
How your work impacted the work unit, team members, customers, and the Department.
The quality of your work and how it made things better.
The responsibilities that were added or removed from your duties during the review period, if any, and why these were added or removed.
Your participation in, and achievements from, team or group activities.
Any performance concerns, for example:
The initiatives you wanted to complete this year but were unable and why.
The obstacles that hindered you from accomplishing your work, if any.
The additional support or direction you feel you need in specific areas.
Professional development achievements. For example:
The training programs or professional development activities you completed.
The ways in which you were able to apply this training and development to your work.
The responsibilities that require you to learn new or additional skills.
Employee Discussion During the End-of-Year Review
Engage in a two-way discussion. Describe to your supervisor how the year went for you, the ways you felt supported, where you might have benefited from additional feedback, or other information that you can both use to work more effectively together in the coming year.
Discuss your specific program plans and goals for the upcoming performance year.
Share your short-range and long-range goals and describe what resources or support you need to achieve these plans. Discuss with your supervisor available training resources or materials that will help you execute your work.
As necessary, ask your supervisor to clarify your performance expectations for the upcoming performance year.
Developing the Individual Development Plan (IDP)
The IDP is a valuable performance enhancement tool for any federal employee. The IDP can be of great assistance to those who want to enhance skills and strengths and learn more about matters of interest that are relevant to the performance of the Department. OpDivs/StaffDivs may require the use of an IDP at their discretion. Contact the HHS University for the IDP or other appropriate forms for documenting employee-development needs.
