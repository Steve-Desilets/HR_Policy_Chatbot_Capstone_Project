Can an employee receive two types of award for the same accomplishment or contribution?

Yes. Departments may use any combination of award types to reward a specific contribution. For example, an employee might receive both a certificate (informal recognition) and a cash award as recognition for a single contribution. However, the overall combined value of the awards should not exceed the value to the organization of the contribution recognized. Thus, the award should be commensurate with the contribution of the employee.

Does a department have to involve its employees in developing appraisal programs, award programs, and employee performance plans?

Departments are encouraged to involve employees in the design and implementation of their appraisal programs, award programs, and employee performance plans. Of course, where a Union has been granted exclusive representation rights, the elected Union representatives represent the bargaining-unit employees in such activities.

Are there limits to the amount of an award a department may approve under its own authority?

Yes. OPM must approve any cash award greater than $10,000 but less than $25,000. Awards greater than $25,000 must be submitted through OPM for the President's approval. The Department of Defense and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may approve awards up to $25,000. SES performance awards and Presidential-rank awards for SES and SL/ST employees have award- specific requirements.

Can an award program cover contract employees?

No. Contract employees may not receive direct payments from the federal government. Their employment, including pay, rewards, and discipline, must be handled by their employer, the contractor, not the federal government.

Performance-Based Awards
What is a performance-based cash award?

A performance-based cash award, also commonly known as a rating-based award, is a cash payment and requires the most recent rating of record as the justification for the award. Rating-based cash awards must be based on a rating of record at the Achieved Expected Results level or higher and rating-based awards programs must make meaningful distinctions based on levels of performance.

Can an employee receiving a Partially Achieved Expected Results rating or an Achieved Unsatisfactory Results rating of record receive a rating-based cash award?

No. An employee must have an Achieved Expected Results rating of record, or higher, to be eligible to receive a rating-based cash award.

Can an employee receive both a rating-based award and an award for a specific contribution (Special Act) in the same year?

Yes. An employee may receive both an award based on a rating of record and an award based on a specific contribution in a single year. The most important factor in deciding whether to grant multiple awards is that the total value of the awards must be commensurate with the value to the department of the recognized accomplishment. In addition, agencies must ensure they comply with all applicable requirements, including OPM approval of awards over $10,000.

Are agencies required to keep award recipient information private?

It depends on the type of award granted. For the most part, compensation-related information in the federal government is a matter of public record or publicly releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Generally, this includes award payments except for rating-based awards.

Departments may not disclose award amounts if doing so could reveal the recipient's rating of record, which is protected information under the Privacy Act. For information on specific situations, contact the Office of General Counsel.

Can an employee receive a rating-based cash award if he/she does not have a rating of record?

No. Rating-based cash awards are based on the rating of record, which is the written justification for the award.
