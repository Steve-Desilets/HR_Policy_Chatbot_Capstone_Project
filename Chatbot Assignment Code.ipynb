      " as with all fish, coral reef fish harbour parasites.\n",
      "What species can sting you?\n",
      " in return, the anemones provide the clownfish protection from their predators, who are not immune to anemone stings.\n",
      "What species are venomous?\n",
      " the most venomous known fish is the reef stonefish.\n",
      "What species are parasitic?\n",
      " parasites of coral reef fish include nematodes, platyhelminthes (cestodes, digeneans, and monogeneans), leeches, parasitic crustaceans such as isopods and copepods, and various microorganisms such as myxosporidia and microsporidia.\n",

      "What are common herbivorous fish?\n",
      " sea anemones are common on reefs.\n",
      "Why do fish camouflage themselves?\n",

      " there is a mutualistic relationship between sea anemones and clownfish.\n",
      "What species have commensalistic relationships?\n",
      " the relationship can be mutualistic, when both species benefit from the relationship, commensalistic, when one species benefits and the other is unaffected, and parasitistic, when one species benefits, and the other is harmed.\n",
      "Where in the world are coral reefs found?\n",
      " coral reefs contain the most diverse fish assemblages to be found anywhere on earth, with perhaps as many as 6,000â€“8,000 species dwelling within coral reef ecosystems of the world's oceans.\n",
      "What species engage in schooling?\n",
