(Note:  All incentives that require OPM approval, as explained in this Instruction and applicable sections of 5 C.F.R. pt. 575, subparts A-C, must have a service agreement.)
Service Period Limitations:  The period of service required for an agreement approving a recruitment or relocation incentive cannot be less than six months nor more than four years.  If a service agreement has already exceeded the four-year time period, it shall terminate at the end of that current fiscal year.  (Note: A service agreement is not necessary for biweekly retention incentive payments, unless the incentive is one that required approval of a waiver request by OPM.)   Service periods begin on the first day of a pay period and end on the last day of a pay period.
