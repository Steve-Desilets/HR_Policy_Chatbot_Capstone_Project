Competency-based Assessments:

OPM describes a competency as “A measurable pattern of knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors, and other characteristics that an individual needs to perform work roles or occupational functions successfully.” Competency assessments represent a whole-person approach to assessing individuals and tend to be either general or technical.

General competencies reflect the cognitive and social capabilities (e.g., problem solving, interpersonal skills) required for job performance in a variety of occupations.
Technical competencies are more specific as they are tailored to the knowledge and skill requirements necessary for a specific job.
OPM has conducted a number of occupational studies to identify competencies for many Federal occupations in the Multipurpose Occupational Systems Analysis - PDF Inventory - Close-Ended (MOSAIC) Competencies library. - PDF
HR Specialist (HRS), Hiring Managers (HM) and Subject Matter Expert (SME) Involvement
HR Specialists, Hiring Managers (HMs), and SMEs all play integral roles in the recruitment and hiring process. Each brings unique insights that are valuable to selecting the best candidates available. The information below highlight examples of the role HRSs, HMs, and SMEs may play in the assessment process. NOTE: Although each role is specifically identified for each process, where more than one party has been identified to participate in a particular process, the absence of one party does not necessarily prevent the assessment process from moving forward. Additionally, examples of other HRS, SME and HM role combinations not listed below may be incorporated into the recruitment process.

Ensure the position description is accurate and up to date (HRS and HM).
Participate in development of the job analysis to identify the most critical competencies for the position (HRS, HM, and SME).
Develop a recruitment strategy (HM and HRS).
Identify or develop assessment tools (HRS, HM, and SME).
Ensure the job opportunity announcement (JOA) accurately describes the job (HRS and HM).
Actively recruit for open positions (HRS, HM, and SME):
Hiring managers and SMEs can share job opportunity announcements with others and invite individuals to apply for positions.
Work with HR during the assessment process (i.e., minimum qualifications review of applicants and identification of assessment tools used to rate and rank candidates) (SME).
If the SME and the HRS do not agree on the rating of an applicant, the HRS makes the final determination of the rating and ranking of the applicant and determines whether the applicant is eligible to be placed on the certificate of eligibles. This is used as a best practice for OpDivs/StaffDivs.
Interview candidates (SME):
SMEs can participate in the development of assessment materials and/or panels as part of the assessment process for a variety of assessment methods, including structured interviews, question development, response benchmark development, and scoring rubrics.
Structured résumé review, including developing scoring benchmarks (HRS and SME).
Writing sample review, including designing writing prompts and developing scoring benchmarks (SME).
Technical questionnaire development, including response options and scoring rubrics (HM and SME).
Talent Team Disagreement
When OpDivs/StaffDivs use talent teams as part of the assessment process, to determine if an applicant should be placed on the certificate of eligibles during subsequent assessment hurdle(s) after the initial assessment hurdle, participants may differ in their evaluations of an applicant’s job-

related competencies. This could happen if multiple talent team participants disagree with each other’s assessment of an applicant, or if one or more talent team participants disagree with the HRS about the results of an applicant assessment that took place during the first assessment hurdle. In this situation, talent team participants should review the applicant’s response (e.g., in an interview, each participant would read aloud their notes of what the candidate said in their response – in many cases, there may be something that was misheard or misunderstood), then have a discussion about how each talent team participant determined their rating for the response. This process continues until talent team participants are close enough in their ratings to provide a consensus rating (e.g., no more than 1 point apart on a 5-point scale). This process helps to ensure that talent team participants are basing their assessment ratings of candidate’s responses on the same information using the same criteria. In the event of an applicant assessment impasse among talent team members, the final applicant assessment rating will be made by the HR Branch Chief responsible for servicing the OpDiv/StaffDiv filling the position. Because applicant assessment ratings determine if they receive a passing grade in the assessment hurdle, in order to receive further employment consideration, ensuring talent team participant consensus is a vital part of the process, when disagreements occur.

Veteran’s Preference
OpDivs/StaffDivs must follow applicable veterans’ preference rules and regulations in the assessment process. Veterans' preference applies after candidates meet minimum qualifications and achieve passing scores on each assessment tool employed. An individual who does not meet the minimum qualifications for a position is not eligible to participate in the assessment process and may not be placed on the certificate of eligibles. All applicants must complete the application process and all assessments tools highlighted in the announcement. An applicant cannot choose to not take an assessment and be deemed qualified or eligible for the position. An individual who does not achieve a passing score on each assessment tool employed may not be placed on the certificate of eligibles.

For most jobs, when using a category rating system, preference eligibles must be selected over non-preference eligibles, except when the position is in a Professional/Scientific series at the GS-9 level and above.
