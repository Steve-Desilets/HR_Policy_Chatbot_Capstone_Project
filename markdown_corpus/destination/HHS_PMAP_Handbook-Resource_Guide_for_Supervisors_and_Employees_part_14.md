What is the difference between the minimum period and the appraisal period?

The minimum period is the shortest length of time established by a department that an employee must perform under assigned elements and standards before a performance rating can be prepared. The appraisal period is the length of time designated by a department (usually one year) that is the basis for the rating of record.

What happens to a performance-based action if a department changes its appraisal program while the action is still in progress?

If a notice of proposed action has been given to the employee, a change to an appraisal program should have no effect on the action. Regulations contain a specific provision, called the "savings provision," that safeguards administrative procedures pending under a previously approved appraisal program, from being disrupted by the implementation of new programs covered by these regulations. OPM's system approval procedures require department appraisal programs to have a similar provision to safeguard pending administrative procedures when programs change.

Does a department have to involve its employees in developing appraisal programs, award programs, and employee performance plans?

All departments are strongly encouraged to involve employees in the design and implementation of their appraisal programs, award programs, and employee performance plans. Of course, where a Union has been granted exclusive recognition, such involvement for bargaining-unit employees must be through their elected Union representatives.

How should a department transition between appraisal programs?

Ideally, a department would close out the current appraisal period and issue ratings of record at the time specified under the existing appraisal program and then begin the next appraisal period under the terms of the new program.

Should there be performance management training for rating officials?

Yes. OPM regulations require departments to train rating officials on performance management topics including developing performance plans, providing feedback, appraising and rewarding performance, and taking timely and appropriate actions on resolving poor performance.

Can a department exclude temporary employees from its performance appraisal system?

Yes. Provided the temporary employees meet the government-wide requirements. A department may exclude an employee who is serving in a position under a temporary position for less than one year, agrees to serve without a performance evaluation, and will not be considered for a reappointment or for an increase in pay based in whole or in part on performance.

If a department is in the middle of the appraisal period and decides to change the number of summary levels used in its appraisal program, is it required to end the current period and give employees a rating of record?

No. Regulations do not require that the appraisal period be ended to change appraisal programs. However, departments need to remember that the regulations permit only a single rating of record in a given appraisal period.

Can a department assume that most employees are performing at an acceptable level, for example, and rate by exception?

No. The statute requires that each employee be appraised against his/her performance plan. It does not allow for appraising an employee by presuming that an employee is meeting performance standards. For the same reason, the process for appraising employees described by the regulations does not provide for any assumed levels of performance.

What is the maximum length allowable for appraisal periods?

The regulations specify that appraisal periods shall generally be designated so that employees are provided a rating of record annually.

May a department establish exceptions to coverage of employees under a performance appraisal system?

Yes, as long as the employees excluded by a department are covered by another performance appraisal system, unless the employees are in the excepted service and the department has obtained separate OPM approval for their exclusion.

Labor Relations
Is there a minimum amount of time an employee must be under the direction of a supervisor before that supervisor can rate that employee?

Government-wide regulations do not establish a minimum time that an employee must be under a supervisor before he/she can be rated. Instead, the regulations require that appraisal programs establish a minimum appraisal period (a minimum amount of time that employees must work under a specific set of elements and standards) before they can be assigned a rating of record. As long as a supervisor has the necessary information and the employee has been under an established set of elements and standards for the minimum appraisal period, the supervisor can assign a rating.

Will an employee's rating of record change if he or she moves to another department or organization that uses a different summary rating pattern?

No. A rating of record does not change when an employee moves to another department or organization, whether or not they use a different summary pattern. However, an employee will not know how many years of additional service credit will be given for a specific rating of record until a department is getting ready to run a Reduction In Force.

May a department grant additional service credit for Reduction In Force based on employees receiving a QSI?

No. The only basis for granting additional service credit for Reduction In Force is a rating of record.

Must a department use performance in the Reduction In Force process?

Yes, under current law, performance ratings must be a factor in the Reduction In Force process. Only under a demonstration project that waives pertinent law or regulation could a department drop the use of performance in a Reduction In Force.

Can ratings given by private industry employers be used as equivalent ratings of record for crediting performance in a Reduction In Force?

No. Only ratings given by federal government entities can be used and only when they meet the requirements for equivalent ratings of record as specified in the performance management regulations.
