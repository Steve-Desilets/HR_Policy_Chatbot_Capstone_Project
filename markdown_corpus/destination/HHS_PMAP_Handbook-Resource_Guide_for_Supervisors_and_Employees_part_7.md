When assigning a rating for each critical element, the rating official should:

Carefully read each performance standard level beginning with the Achieved Expected Results standard which is considered the base-level standard.
Determine the level that best describes the employee’s performance on the element. The sum of the employee’s performance of the element must, in the Rating Official’s judgment, meet the assigned level’s criteria.
The rating official should conduct a thorough performance rating meeting with the employee that conforms to the following guidelines:
All required performance plan actions and approvals have been completed.
Schedule the meeting in a private and interruption-free location.
Conduct the session in a professional and calm demeanor, focused on performance and work- related issues.
Address each element with a discussion of noteworthy items, both positive and constructive, and an explanation of the rating based on the relevant element and standards.
Summarize the employee’s overall performance as it relates to the assigned rating of record.
Provide adequate time for the employee to give input and feedback, ask questions, and express concerns.
Have the employee sign and date the performance plan.
Sign and date the block for the rating official on the performance plan.
Narrative Summaries
A narrative is required when an employee’s performance is at the “Achieved Unsatisfactory Results (UR)” or “Achieved Outstanding Results (AO)” level. The narrative should contain examples of the employee’s performance which substantiate how the employee’s performance falls within the levels assigned. Narratives are recorded on the performance plan. A narrative is not required for the “Achieved More Than Expected Results (AM)”, “Achieved Expected Results (AE)”, or the “Partially Achieved Expected Results (PA)” levels but may be written if the Rating Official desires to provide this level of feedback to the employee.

Disagreement with Rating
Recognizing that there may be differences of opinion between employees and Rating Officials on performance assessments and ratings, employees may respond to performance ratings and request reconsideration. Employee comments become a part of the official appraisal rating of record.

Reconsideration actions may include:

Employees who desire to add such written comments shall have seven (7) calendar days from the date of the issuance of the appraisal.
Employee comments must be reviewed by the Rating and Reviewing Officials to determine whether these comments warrant any changes in the element or summary ratings to be submitted for the record.
Reviewing Officials may elect to change the rating of record. This amended rating will be entered into the performance plan and signed by the Reviewing Official and the employee.
Employees being reduced in grade or removed based on performance have the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board; or if an employee believes he or she was discriminated against based on any of the protected classes or actions, an EEO complaint may be filed.
Please be aware that the written comment requirements may be modified by the specific Collective Bargaining Agreements negotiated for your OpDiv/StaffDiv, so it is critical that you consult your designated LER representative to ensure appropriate formal compliance requirements are met.

Rewarding Performance
A basic principle of effective management is that performance is influenced by positive and negative consequences. Positive consequences include rewards and recognition, promotions, Within-Grade Increases (WGI), etc. Negative consequences may include counseling, reassigning, removing, or downgrading the employee.

Performance Award Eligibility
Performance awards are an integral part of the performance appraisal process. As such, they are linked to the rating of record and submitted and considered for approval only at the conclusion of the rating period.

Employees whose summary rating is Achieved Outstanding Results may be eligible to receive a performance award payment of up to five (5) percent of salary, including locality payment or special rate supplement. This award is based on the salary as of the last day of the rating period (December 31).

Only employees who receive an Achieved Outstanding Results rating may be eligible for a Quality Step Increase (QSI). Employees who are rated at the Achieved More than Expected Results, Achieved Expected Results, Partially Achieved Expected Results, or Achieved Unsatisfactory Results may not be considered for a QSI. Only General Schedule (GS) employees are eligible to receive a QSI. QSIs must be awarded based on an Achieved Outstanding Results rating for the previous rating cycle and not for midyear performance accomplishments. In addition, an employee may not receive a QSI and a cash award or time-off award for the same performance and a QSI may not be granted to an employee who has received a QSI within the preceding fifty-two (52) consecutive calendar weeks. QSIs are not automatic and may be awarded at management’s discretion and subject to funds availability.
