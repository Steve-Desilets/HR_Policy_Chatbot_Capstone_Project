HR Centers may appoint any ICTAP candidate when two (2) or more qualified ICTAP candidates apply for a vacancy.
Applicant Notification and Second-Level Review: All ICTAP candidates who apply for a specific vacancy must be sent a written notice of the final status of their application, including whether the candidate was determined to be ‘Well Qualified;’ if another ICTAP candidate was hired; if the vacancy was filled under one of the exceptions listed in Appendix B; or if the recruitment was canceled. Additionally, if the candidate was determined not well qualified, the HR Center must conduct a second-level review by another HR Specialist and document the job-related reasons for the determination; and notify such ICTAP candidates with the results of the independent second-level review.
ICTAP obligations must be cleared at the initial announcement. See Section 330-2-80, Advertising Vacant Positions.
After the OpDiv/StaffDiv announces the vacancy in USAStaffing and meets its obligations to any CTAP or ICTAP candidate(s) who applied to the delegated examining announcement and qualified RPL registrant(s) on the HHS RPL, the HR Center may fill the vacant position with any other external candidate who applied to the vacancy, following appropriate delegated examining procedures (See Sections 330-2-60 and 90 of this Instruction).

330-2-80: Advertising Vacant Positions to Clear CTAP or ICTAP
HHS CTAP candidates must have access to information on all HHS vacant positions in their local commuting area, in accordance with 5 CFR §330.608(c).
A vacant position is a permanent or time-limited competitive service position at GS-15 or below (or equivalent) to be filled for a total of 121 days or more, including all extensions.
All HHS vacant positions are posted on USAStaffing, in accordance with 5 CFR Part 330, Subpart A, unless the position is filled via an exception listed in Appendix A or B.
All JOAs must contain (5 CFR §330.104):
The HHS definition of ‘Well Qualified’ in this Instruction; and
Require the following documentation to show proof of CTAP/ICTAP eligibility:
Accepting HHS candidates (internal to OpDiv/StaffDiv or HHS-wide): ‘Provide one of the following documents: A copy of your RIF separation notice or notice of position abolishment; notice of proposed removal for declining a directed reassignment or change in duty location; or official notice stating you are eligible for discontinued service retirement.’
Accepting candidates outside HHS: ‘Provide one of the following documents: A copy of the your RIF separation notice or notice of position abolishment; notice of proposed removal for declining a directed reassignment or change in duty location; official notice stating you are eligible for discontinued service retirement; agency certification that it cannot place you after your recovery from a compensable work-related injury or illness; official military notice stating you are eligible for a special disability retirement for Military Reserve or National Guard technicians; or notice from OPM stating your disability retirement annuity has been or will be terminated.’
‘A copy of your most recent SF-50 "Notification of Personnel Action'', showing position title, series, grade level, and duty location;’ and
‘A copy of your latest performance appraisal including your official rating.’
Remote Work (as defined in OPM’s 2021 Guide on Telework and Remote Work in the Federal Government - PDF and HHS Instruction 990-1, Workplace Flexibilities).
When advertising a full-time remote position or a position eligible for full-time remote work (i.e., the employee works at an approved alternate worksite with no expectation to report to the agency worksite on a regular or recurring basis), the duty location is ‘Anywhere in the U.S.’ or ‘Location is Negotiable After Selection, U.S.’ In addition to (2)(a)-(d) above, the JOA must inform applicants the position being filled has been designated as/is remote.
In cases where there is some frequency in which the position requires an onsite presence (e.g., the employee reports to the agency worksite less than 2 days per bi-weekly pay period, or on an irregular but consistent basis, etc.), the vacancy should be advertised with the duty location of the agency worksite, and CTAP/ICTAP is cleared for the advertised official duty location.
If a hiring official wants to make selection(s) for full-time remote work from an announcement that was advertised with specific duty location(s) (e.g., Washington, DC; or Seattle, WA and Denver, CO), the vacancy must be readvertised with a duty location of ‘Anywhere in the U.S.’ (or equivalent) or ‘Location is Negotiable After Selection, U.S.’ to give all eligible candidates the opportunity to apply.
Hiring officials should be advised that the duty location of employees appointed via the competitive service cannot be changed within 90 days of appointment from the location advertised in the vacancy announcement, consistent with the merit system principle of fair and open competition (5 CFR §330.502). OPM may waive this regulatory restriction upon written request from the ASA/OHR if the OpDiv/StaffDiv can justify an urgent need (e.g., an unforeseen/emergency situation arising in the new duty location including an explanation why another employee cannot be utilized, or an emergency situation on the part of the employee the OpDiv/StaffDiv is seeking to accommodate, etc.). Such requests must be submitted by the HR Center to employmentpolicy@hhs.gov.
CTAP/ICTAP/RPL obligations must be cleared at initial announcement. Additional clearance requirements may be specified in HHS Instruction, 300-2, Shared Certificates Program, when using shared certificates.
