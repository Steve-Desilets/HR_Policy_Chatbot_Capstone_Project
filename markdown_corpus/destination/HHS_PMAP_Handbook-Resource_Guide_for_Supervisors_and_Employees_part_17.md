The appraisal period covers the Calendar Year (January 1 through December 31). In the Department, the minimum appraisal period is ninety (90) calendar days. An employee must perform work under a performance plan in place for a minimum of ninety (90) calendar days to receive a rating.

Critical Element: Work assignments or responsibilities of such importance that unacceptable performance on the element would result in a determination that an employee’s overall performance is unacceptable. All elements in the performance plan are critical.

HHS FORM 704B: The standard performance plan used to document all of the written performance elements that an employee is expected to accomplish during the appraisal period. See Performance Plan definition below.

Performance: An employee’s accomplishment of assigned work as specified in the critical elements of the employee’s position.

Performance Management Appraisal Program (PMAP): The framework of Department-wide policies and parameters established for planning, monitoring, developing, evaluating, and rewarding individual performance. The resulting performance information will be used in making personnel decisions.

Performance Awards Budget: The amount of money allocated by the Department and/or the OpDiv/StaffDiv, based on OMB guidelines, for distribution as performance awards to covered employees.

Performance Plan: All of the written performance elements and standards that an employee is expected to accomplish during the appraisal period. These objectives are linked to strategic plans and outcomes of the Department and the OpDivs/StaffDivs. A performance plan must include all critical Elements and their Performance Standards.

Performance Rating: The written appraisal of performance compared to the performance standards for each critical element on which there have been an opportunity to perform for the minimum period, for example ninety (90) calendar days. A performance rating includes the assignment of a summary rating level.

Performance Standard: A statement of the performance threshold, requirement, or expectation for an element that must be met to be appraised at a particular level of performance. A performance standard may focus on, for example, factors such as quality, quantity, timeliness, and manner of performance.

One formal progress review is required and is generally conducted midway through the appraisal period. Ratings are not assigned for progress reviews.

Quality Step Increase (QSI): A permanent increase in basic pay, equivalent to one (1) step within the grade.

Summary Rating: Combining the written appraisals of each critical element on which there has been an opportunity to perform for the minimum period of ninety (90) calendar days to assign a summary rating level. The rating official derives the summary rating from appraising the employee’s performance during the appraisal period on each element.
