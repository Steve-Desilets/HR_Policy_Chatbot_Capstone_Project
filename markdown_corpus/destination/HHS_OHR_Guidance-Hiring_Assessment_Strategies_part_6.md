Job Opportunity Announcement (JOA)
OpDiv/StaffDiv HR Centers must include the basis for rating applicants in the JOA. This is listed in the “How You Will Be Evaluated” section of the JOA, and at a minimum, the description of the assessment process should include:

A general overview of the assessment process – this need not be exhaustive but should provide applicants an idea of what the process will entail and what types of assessments they will complete (e.g., writing sample, online questionnaire, USA Hire, etc.).
A list of the competencies to be assessed during the assessment process, including the competency titles and definitions identified during the job analysis and targeted in the assessment process. (See Appendix F for sample JOA reflecting competencies with definitions.)
Tracking Results
Regardless of the assessment tool(s) chosen as part of an OpDiv/StaffDiv assessment strategy, it is important to evaluate the results received from the assessments used. This ensures that any assessment used is consistently identifying the best candidates for positions. Additionally, evaluating assessment effectiveness is also required of agencies per Executive Order 13932.
OpDiv/StaffDivs may accomplish this in several ways, as reflected below. Please note that this list is not exhaustive.

Reviewing Hiring Manager Satisfaction Survey data to examine managers’ perceptions of the quality of candidates on certificates.
Reviewing Applicant Satisfaction Survey data to examine applicants’ perceptions of the fairness and job-relatedness of assessments used in the assessment process.
Reviewing Time to Hire data to evaluate the impact of the assessment process on timely hiring practices.
Tracking utilization of shared services assessment tools such as USA Hire to ensure optimization of available assessment options.
Reviewing Applicant Flow Data in order to identify barriers to recruiting a well-qualified and diverse candidate pool.
Seek feedback from the hiring manager after a vacancy is filled or if a certificate is returned without a selection
Track and review the performance of particular assessment tools in various hiring scenarios (e.g., how well are SME interview panels working for selecting for scientist positions, or how effectively are evaluations of writing samples in identifying candidates with writing skills)
Obtain feedback from SMEs involved in the assessment process.
Questions to be asked by OpDiv/StaffDiv HR representative, talent team members, etc. to hiring managers at the end of the hiring process may include:
General: Were assessment instructions easy to follow?
General: Did the assessment help in identifying talented candidates?
General: Did the assessment process make sense for the position being filled?
Scoring Rubrics (for interviews, writing samples, etc.): How well did scoring benchmarks match up to candidates’ responses?
Work Sample: How closely did the assessment match the work performed on the job?
By regularly obtaining feedback, evaluating the effectiveness of the assessment processes, and making adjustments, OpDivs/StaffDivs can ensure that their assessments contribute to success in hiring the best candidates.

Policy Impact
Non-competitive Actions: There is no change to how agencies effect non-competitive actions. Appointments to competitive service positions must be made from individuals who meet OPM qualifications, with limited exceptions. Agencies have the option to verify, through use of a passing grade assessment, that an individual has the right competencies to be successful in the position. The use of a multi-hurdle, passing grade assessment is optional.

Special Appointing Authorities: There is no change to how agencies use special appointing authorities. Appointments to competitive service positions must be made from individuals who meet OPM qualifications, with limited exceptions. Agencies must ensure selectees meet

the qualification requirements of the position by meeting the education and/or experience requirements described in the OPM General Schedule Qualification Standard for the occupation at the grade level of the position being filled; and through use of a passing grade assessment that indicates an individual has the needed KSAs/competencies to be successful in the position, if used. Additional assessment for rating and ranking purposes would depend on the requirements of the appointing authority used.

Suggested Best Practices
Below are practices that can assist HRSs, HMs and SMEs in the recruitment process. While incorporation of these practices is not required, and the list of practices is not exhaustive, use of these and other practices not listed, where appropriate, can help strengthen facilitation of the recruitment process.

Work with the hiring manager to decide how to involve SMEs before the job opportunity announcement is posted.
Ensure that HR provides oversight of SME involvement throughout the recruitment and hiring process of the OpDiv/StaffDiv serviced.
Note that the same non-hiring manager SME may be involved in multiple phases of the assessment process (e.g. reviewing resumes, rating and ranking applicants, participating in selection interviews). OpDivs/StaffDivs may issue alternate internal guidance.
Verify responses from applicant self-report questionnaires with resume.
Base some part of the assessment process on general competencies (e.g., interpersonal skills, teamwork, writing).
Provide a strong verification statement up front in the job opportunity announcement or the instructions of the self-report questionnaire. The exact wording can vary, but often a verification statement at the beginning of the questionnaire will inform candidates that 1) their responses to the questionnaire will be verified, and 2) that there will be consequences for falsification of their information (e.g., adjustment of their score on the questionnaire, removal from consideration for the position, etc.).
Place a reasonable limit on the number of pages of a résumé that will be reviewed as part of the initial qualification determination. This limit must be clearly explained in the job opportunity announcement (e.g., state in the job opportunity announcement, “Please limit your résumé to 5 pages. If more than 5 pages are submitted, only the first 5 pages will be reviewed to determine your qualifications.”).
