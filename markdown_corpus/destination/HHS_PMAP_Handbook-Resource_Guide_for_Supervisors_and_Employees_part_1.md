HHS PMAP Handbook, Resource Guide for Supervisors and Employees

Introduction
Managing employee performance is an integral part of the work that all managers and rating officials perform throughout the year. It is as important as managing financial resources and program outcomes because the degree of employee performance has a profound effect on both the financial and programmatic components of any organization.

The Performance Management Appraisal Program (PMAP) policy of the Department of Health and Human Services is designed to document the expectations for both individual and organizational performance, provide a meaningful process by which employees can be rewarded for noteworthy contributions to the organization, and provide direction to improve organizational success at every level.

To accomplish these objectives, managers need to identify organizational goals to be accomplished, communicate individual and organizational goals to employees that support the overall strategic mission and the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goals of the Department, monitor and evaluate employee performance, and use performance as a basis for appropriate personnel actions including rewarding noteworthy performance and taking remedial action to improve performance not meeting expectations.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) defines performance management as the systematic process of:

Planning work and setting expectations.
Continually monitoring performance.
Developing the capacity to perform.
Periodically rating overall performance.
Rewarding noteworthy performance.
This HHS PMAP Handbook complements the Department’s PMAP policy, dated November 9, 2022, and provides supervisors and employees with a uniform working guide for the day-to-day administration of performance management. This handbook is intended to help supervisors manage employee performance that is aligned with and in support of organizational goals.

This handbook includes step-by-step explanations, and easy-to-follow checklists, for activities conducted throughout the performance cycle, and it standardizes working procedures to ensure consistent conformance to Departmental requirements. As such, this handbook serves as a valuable training resource especially as a quick overview of performance management requirements for supervisors and employees, including new employees. The policy now explicitly excludes all SES-equivalent Title 42 employees.

This handbook provides information and guidance and must not be construed to contradict Departmental PMAP policy or any Collective Bargaining Agreement. Please direct all questions and concerns to the Performance Management Division, Office of the Secretary, at OSPMAP@HHS.GOV.

Importance of Performance Management
In today's workplace, performance improvement and the role of performance management are increasingly popular topics. Why the intense focus on performance management now? Business pressures are ever-increasing and organizations are now required to become even more effective and efficient, execute better business strategies, and do more with less to remain competitive.

The primary reason to ensure performance management processes are functioning properly is to tighten the link between strategic business objectives and day-to-day actions. Effective goal setting (including timelines), combined with a method to track progress and identify obstacles, contribute to success and bottom-line results. Regularly tracking progress against performance goals and objectives also provides the opportunity to recognize and reward employees for performance and exceptional effort, contributing to job satisfaction, and productivity.

What is the impact of a poorly structured and implemented performance management process? If individual goals are not aligned with business strategy, then time and resources are wasted. Low employee engagement levels may mean that individuals are not performing at their best. Inconsistent evaluation criteria and rewards can lead to mistrust, lower productivity, and higher attrition. If top performers see no differentiation in performance ratings, no opportunities, and unfair compensation for under-performers, morale can suffer. Lack of documentation, visibility, and accountability can negatively affect stakeholders who are demanding more transparency. If accurate performance information is unavailable, or difficult to access, training and development decisions, along with project assignment decisions, may not be made in the Department’s, or in the individual's, best interests. An annual process will not adequately alert managers to problems in a timely manner. Last, but not least, a lack of proper documentation related to performance may result in legal issues.

Management "buy-in" is essential to the performance management process. When management does not understand the importance and value of the process, the results can range from consistently late or incomplete appraisals to employee-management mistrust, avoidance of performance discussions, and a lack of honest performance-related discussions. Additionally, managers may feel unprepared to deliver quality feedback and to oversee effective performance discussions.
