HHS Office of Human Resources Guidance, Hiring Assessment Strategies

A.  Purpose.

This guidance is provided to establish procedures and clarify regulatory requirements under Executive Order (EO) 13932 and sets forth the policy for the use of hiring assessments in determining what applicants for competitive service positions within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will be placed on the Certificate(s) of Eligibles. This process is known as the assessment process. To the extent that this policy guidance contradicts with other HHS policies, this policy should prevail.

On June 26, 2020, Executive Order 13932, Modernizing and Reforming the Assessment and Hiring of Federal Job Candidates was issued. The EO reminded agencies of their legal obligation to use valid, competency-based assessments and directed them to scale back reliance upon educational qualifications as a substitute for competencies in the Federal hiring process.
Specifically, the EO directed agencies to do the following:

Refrain from relying solely on candidate self-assessment of their qualifications (e.g., occupational questionnaires). Applicants are to clear other assessment hurdles in order to be considered qualified in examinations and thus eligible for preference and referral.
Continually evaluate the effectiveness of different assessment tools to ensure the quality and integrity of their hiring process.
The applicant assessment process used will vary, depending on the type of position being filled, the competencies identified for that position, the volume of applicants anticipated and the resources available (e.g., time, budget, and subject matter expertise). With these variables in mind, a multi-hurdle approach to an assessment process may not be a viable option for each position. When designing an assessment strategy, the use of a multi-hurdle approach must align with the hiring needs of each OpDiv/StaffDiv. For example, low volume hiring or entry level work may not require the use of a multiple hurdle approach.
Using effective assessment tools will reduce the degree of error in making hiring decisions. Well-developed assessment tools will allow HHS Operating and Staff Divisions (OpDivs/StaffDivs) to specifically target the competencies and skills they seek. This helps to ensure the time spent by both applicants and HHS personnel adds value to the decision- making process. Selection errors have financial and practical impacts on organizations. The consequences of even a single selection error can create problems for an entire work unit. Some selection errors can have Department-wide consequences such as customer service complaints, increases in work-related accidents and injuries, high absenteeism, poor work quality, increased turnover, or damage to the reputation of the Department.

B.  Coverage.

This guidance covers the requirements of Executive Order 13932 and applies to all vacancies in the competitive service, with the exception of competitive hiring actions that do not require competitive rating and ranking of candidates (e.g., when using a direct hire authority). It does not cover vacancies in the excepted service (e.g., Pathways, Schedule A hiring, etc.) or the Senior Executive Service.

When the provisions of a negotiated labor/management agreement differ from the provisions of this policy, the agreement takes precedence for those employees covered by the negotiated labor/management agreement.

Assessment: A valid, reliable, and systematic approach to gathering information about individuals. This information is used to make employment or career-related decisions about applicants and employees.
Assessment Tool/Hurdle: A device or method used to measure the degree to which an applicant possesses the competencies/KSAs necessary for successful job performance (i.e., occupational questionnaires, rating schedules, written tests, work samples, and structured interviews, etc.).
Category Rating: A method of evaluating candidates who meet eligibility and minimum qualification requirements for the position by assessing the applicants' experience, education, and training and placing them into pre-defined "quality categories" rather than assigning individual numerical scores.
Federal Anti-Discrimination Laws: Federal laws designed to protect workers from various forms of employment discrimination and harassment. These federal discrimination laws apply to all phases of employment, from the job listing and interview process to termination (i.e., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978; Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended; Rehabilitation Act of 1973; Equal Pay Act of 1963; Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008.)
Industrial-Organizational (I/O) Psychologist: Credentialed expert that focus on the behavior of employees in the workplace, by applying psychological principles and research methods to improve the overall work environment for the organization.
Job Analysis: A systematic method for gathering, documenting, and analyzing information about the content, context, and requirements of the job. It demonstrates that there is a clear relationship between the tasks performed on the job and the competencies/KSAs required to perform the tasks. Job analysis information is used to develop employee selection procedures, identify training needs, define performance standards, and other uses.
Job Opportunity Announcement: A document that informs the public about a job vacancy in the federal service, describes the requirements of the job, and instructs applicants on how to apply for the vacancy.
Minimum Qualifications: Qualifications that an applicant must possess to be eligible to participate in an assessment for hire under the competitive system, e.g., education, experience, and/or other requirements (e.g., licensure). Applicants who do not meet the minimum qualification requirements for the position receive no further consideration.
Occupational Questionnaire: An assessment tool used to assess applicants’ qualifications and experience. Occupational questionnaires generally ask candidates to self-report their level of training and experience in carrying out critical tasks and demonstrating critical competencies identified through job analysis.
Preference Eligible: An individual who meets the definition of a “preference eligible” veteran, spouse, widow/widower, or parent.
Subject Matter Expert: A person with bona fide expert knowledge of the responsibilities, duties, day-to-day functions, competencies/knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), and requirements of a position.
Subject Matter Expert-Qualifying Assessment (SME-QA): A subject matter expert participating in the process of developing/identifying effective assessment tools for utilization in the hiring process.
Talent Team: A team comprised of highly skilled individuals with a strong knowledgebase in Human Resource (HR) policies, practices, and operations.
