511-1-110 Classification Appeal Filing Procedures
If an employee is appealing to HHS, appeals must be addressed in writing to the Director, Talent Acquisition Division, in OHR. The following information is submitted by the appellant or his/her representative via their servicing OHRO to employmentpolicy@hhs.gov:
A signed statement that the employee wishes to appeal the classification of his/her position;
Organization to which assigned;
Current position pay plan, title, series, and grade;
The requested pay plan, title, series, and/or grade;
A statement explaining how the official PD is inaccurate or a statement of how the duties performed differ from the official PD;
A statement with the reasons why the position should be classified differently. If the interpretation of a specific standard(s) is at issue, an analysis comparing the position with the pertinent standard(s) should be included; and
A written designation of third party representation if the appellant elects such representation. The designation must include the name, phone number, email address, and mailing address of the representative.
The following supplemental information should be submitted by the servicing OHRO to OHR at employmentpolicy@hhs.gov for appeals to HHS:
The PD (including the OF-8) to which the incumbent is assigned which meets standards of adequacy and which is consistent with the position evaluation statement;
A position evaluation statement which includes an in-depth comparison of the duties and responsibilities with published classification standards;
Organizational chart in which the position resides with pay plans, series, and grades;
Comments from the immediate supervisor (or higher level official) relative to the accuracy of the PD and the merits of the appeal;
Copies of all PDs for positions directly supervised or led by the appealed position, and supporting evaluation statement, if applicable; and
A copy of immediate supervisor's PD and evaluation statement, if applicable.
HHS must take action on appeals submitted to HHS within 60 calendar days (5 C.F.R. § 511.604). OHR will forward the appeal to OPM if the employee has directed the appeal to OPM and the HHS decision is not favorable; HHS is not authorized to act on the appeal; or HHS has not made a determination on the appeal within the 60 calendar day time period.
Appeals to OPM:
The employee or his/her designated representative, who must be designated in writing, should send the appeal to: U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Classification Appeals and FLSA Claims Program Manager,1900 E. ST NW Room 6484, Washington, DC 20415.
OPM requires the following information in writing and must be signed by the employee or his/her designated representative:
Employee name, mailing address, and commercial office telephone number;
The present classification of the employee’s position and the requested classification;
The name of the department or agency and the office in which the employee works;
The city where the employee is employed and the mailing address;
A copy of the employee’s official PD and either a statement affirming that it is accurate or a detailed explanation of the inaccuracies and an explanation of the efforts made to correct the PD;
Any additional information about the position that will aid in understanding it; and
Arguments supporting the requested classification by referencing the appropriate classification standards.
A duplicate copy of all material provided to OPM shall be forwarded through appropriate channels to OHR. Upon receipt of the OPM decision, a copy shall also be forwarded to OHR in order to complete the case file. OHROs maintain complete files on classification appeal adjudications under their jurisdiction.
Pending classification appeals are canceled by HHS if the appellant:
Requests in writing that his/her appeal be withdrawn or canceled;
No longer occupies the appealed position (except when the employee would be entitled to the retroactive benefits);
Does not furnish information required by the agency or otherwise does not proceed with the advancement of the appeal; or
An employee filed an appeal to HHS on which a decision is pending, and then appeals to OPM.
Reconsideration Requests
Appellants desiring to formally request reconsideration of a HHS or an OPM classification appeal decision should submit the request to OHR at employmentpolicy@hhs.gov within 45 days from the date of the decision.
Both HHS and OPM may reconsider appeals at its discretion if the request contains new material information or disagreements over the significance of information or when a written argument or evidence is presented that establishes reasonable doubt concerning the technical accuracy of the decision (5 C.F.R. § 511.613 for General Schedule and 5 C.F.R. § 532.705 (b)(f) for Federal Wage appeal reconsiderations). Reconsiderations may be used under circumstances where a written argument or evidence establishes that:
New and material evidence is available that was not readily available when the previous decision was issued;
The previous decision involves an erroneous interpretation of law or regulation or a misapplication of established policy; or
The previous decision is of a precedential nature involving a new or unreviewed policy consideration that may have effects beyond the actual case at hand, or is otherwise of such an exceptional nature as to merit the personal attention of the Director of OPM.
If the appellant is filing for reconsideration with HHS or OPM, the request must be in writing and filed not later than 45 calendar days after the decision is issued. Regardless if an employee is filing for reconsideration with HHS/OHR or OPM, a copy of all packages for reconsideration must be submitted to OHR.
