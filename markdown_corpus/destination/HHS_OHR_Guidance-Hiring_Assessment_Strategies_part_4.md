Example 1: Job Knowledge Test + Subject Matter Expert (SME) Panel Interview
applications in USAJOBS, applicants complete an automated, multiple- choice job knowledge test questionnaire. This test consists of 15-20 technical subject matter area questions developed by SMEs. Scores for candidates to be minimally qualified range from 70-100, depending on applicants’ responses to the questionnaire. Although a minimally qualifying score of 70 has been established in the USA Staffing system, SMEs have established a cut-off score of 85. All candidates with a score of 85 or above on the knowledge test will advance to the next assessment phase and participate in a structured interview with a SME panel (Appendix A sample). Scoring on the interview panel ranges from 70-100, however, the SME panel determines that a score of 90 or above is the cut- off required for applicants to move to the next hurdle. All candidates scoring a 90 or above on the interview are listed on the certificate of eligibles, with all preference-eligible candidates listed above non-veterans.

Example 2: Occupational Questionnaire + Writing Sample + SME Panel Interview
When submitting applications in USAJOBS, applicants complete a short multiple-choice, self-report questionnaire about their experience and expertise. Scores for minimally qualified candidates range from 70-100, depending on their responses to the questionnaire. According to SMEs, a cut-off score of 80 is required for applicants to progress to the next hurdle. All candidates with a score of 80 or above advance to the next assessment phase. These candidates are invited to submit a writing sample. Each writing sample is evaluated by SMEs using a structured scoring rubric to assess candidates’ technical writing skills (Appendix C and E samples). All candidates with a score of 85 or above advance to the next assessment phase and are invited to participate in a structured interview with a SME panel. Scoring on the interview ranges from 80-100. All candidates scoring an 80 or above on the interview are listed on the certificate of eligibles, with all preference eligible candidates listed above non-veterans.

Example 3: Occupational Questionnaire + SME Panel Interview
When submitting applications in USAJOBS, applicants complete a short multiple-choice, self-report questionnaire about their experience and expertise. Scores for minimally qualified candidates range from 70-100, depending on applicants’ responses to the questionnaire. Although the minimal score is 70, SMEs establish a cut-off score of 80 for the questionnaire. All candidates with a score of 80 or above advance to the next structured SME panel interview assessment phase. Scoring on the structured interview ranges from 70-100, however the SME panel determines that a score of 90 or above is the cut-off for candidates to be referred to the selecting official. All candidates scoring a 90 or above on the interview are listed on the certificate of eligibles and referred to the selecting official, with all preference eligibles listed above non-veterans.

Example 4: Occupational Questionnaire + SME Resume Review
When submitting their applications in USAJOBS, applicants complete a short multiple- choice, self-report questionnaire about their experience and expertise. Scores for minimally qualified candidates range from 70-100, depending on their responses to the questionnaire. All applicants whose self-ratings place them in the pre-determined cut-off score (i.e., 80 and above) are reviewed by the Human Resources Specialist (HRS) to confirm that eligibility and basic qualification requirements are met (including any minimum education requirements). All eligible and qualified candidates with a score of 80 or above

advance to the next SME resume assessment phase. The SME panel will independently conduct resume reviews using a pre-determined scoring matrix based on the competencies and task statements contained in the job analysis (Appendix B sample). A total of five competencies will be assessed, and scoring for each competency will range from 0-5, with 5 being the highest score, based on the information reflected in the resume. The SME panel determines the overall cut-off score that will be used for the resume review hurdle is 20 (highest possible score is 25). The panel convenes to discuss and tally the scores for each applicant. All candidates with a score of at least 20 or above are listed on the certificate of eligibles and referred to the selecting official, with all preference eligibles listed above non-veterans.

Low volume hiring or entry level work may not require the use of a multiple hurdle approach. The OPM’s Assessment and Selection website, section Designing an Assessment Strategy includes key areas of consideration and resources for designing an assessment strategy.

Manual and Automated Assessments
OpDivs/StaffDivs are permitted to use manual and/or automated assessments, supported by competency-based assessment tools, including job analysis. Manual assessments are administered outside of the staffing system and then candidate scores are input into the system manually. Automated assessments are administered to candidates directly via the staffing system. Listed below are examples of assessments that may be used by OpDivs/StaffDivs. Other assessments not listed may be used as well.

Examples of automated assessments include:

Multiple choice occupational questionnaires (e.g., self-report questionnaires)
Job knowledge test items (as incorporated into the automated questionnaire system)
Examples of manual assessments include:

Writing Assessments
Structured Interviews
Rating Schedules (crediting plans or benchmarks)
Structured SME Resume Reviews
For additional information on how to administer both manual and automated assessment types in USA Staffing, please contact your USA Staffing Account Manager.
