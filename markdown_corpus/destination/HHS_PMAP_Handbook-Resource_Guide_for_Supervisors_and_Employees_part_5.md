Employee Participation
Supervisors and managers are strongly encouraged to involve their employees in establishing the performance plan for the employees’ positions. Participation enables employees to more clearly understand their roles and responsibilities and the level of performance that is required of them; as well as the role their positions play in the mission of the organization. However, the final decision regarding critical elements and standards always rests with the management official.

Employee participation may be accomplished in various ways, for example:

Employee and rating official jointly developing the performance plan.
Employee providing the rating official with a draft plan.
Rating official providing the employee with a draft plan.
Employee writing one of the critical elements that he/she performs in his/her position.
Once finalized, the employee is asked to sign the performance plan to acknowledge receipt of the plan and established performance expectations. If an employee declines signature, the supervisor should explain that the signature indicates receipt, not agreement. In cases where an employee refuses to sign a plan, the supervisor is authorized to implement the performance standards without employee agreement. Supervisors should annotate the employee’s refusal to sign in the employee’s signature block.

Documenting Elements and Standards
The critical elements and standards described at the Achieved Expected Results level, at a minimum, must be documented on the performance plan and signed by the rating official and the employee. In addition, an OpDiv/StaffDiv may require the reviewing official to review/approve the performance plan.

Monitoring Performance
Feedback During the Performance Cycle
Performance plans should be developed and implemented within thirty (30) calendar days of the following:

beginning of the appraisal period;
employee’s entrance on duty;
assignment of an employee to a detail or temporary promotion scheduled to exceed eighty-nine (89) calendar days; or
assignment of an employee to a new position.
Effective and timely feedback during the performance appraisal period addressing employee performance against the established performance elements and standards is an essential component of a successful performance management program. Employees need to know in a timely manner how well they are performing and if there are areas that require improvement. Feedback can come from many different sources, such as observation by managers and rating officials, measurement systems, feedback from peers, and input from customers. The rating official is responsible for determining the types, sources, and means of collecting the data and feedback that most accurately gauge performance, to ensure that each of the supervisor’s employees receives an accurate, effective, and timely rating.
