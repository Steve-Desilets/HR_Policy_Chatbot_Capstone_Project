OHR Guidance Post-Secondary Students and College Graduates

A.  Purpose.

This guidance establishes hiring procedures and reporting requirements for two (2) new competitive service hiring authorities for 1) Post-Secondary Students and 2) College graduates.  These hiring authorities are not part of the Pathways Programs.  The 2019 National Defense Authorization Act established them, which required the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to revise regulations to allow certain positions to be filled.  

When this guidance differs from changes in applicable law or regulation, the changes in law or regulation apply.

B.  Coverage.

This guidance covers time-limited appointments via the Post-Secondary Student hiring authority  (5 CFR 316, Subpart I) and permanent appointments via the College Graduate hiring authority (5 CFR §315.614) at the GS-11 grade level (or equivalent) and below.  The specific competitive service authority must be cited in personnel actions when filling positions.

The provisions of this guidance pertaining to conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees are fully negotiable in accordance with 5 U.S.C. Chapter 71. When the provisions of this guidance differ from the requirements contained in applicable collective bargaining agreement(s), the agreement takes precedence for covered bargaining unit employees.

E.  Hiring Limits (5 CFR §§315.614(i) and 316.913)

READ CAREFULLY.  Each fiscal year, OpDivs/StaffDivs cannot exceed the hiring limits in the regulations cited above and described below: 
Post-Secondary Student Authority:  The annual hire limit is 15% of the total number of student appointments to positions at the GS-11 level or below made by OpDiv/StaffDiv during the previous fiscal year.

Student appointments made via the Pathways Intern (5 CFR §213.3402(a)) and Post-Secondary Student (5 CFR 316, Subpart I) hiring authorities may be used to calculate the annual hiring limit.

Appointments made via direct hire excepted service (except for the Pathways Intern Program), non-competitive authorities, or merit promotion cannot be used to calculate the Post-Secondary Student hiring limit. 
College Graduate Authority:  The annual hire limit is 15% of the total number of persons appointed by the OpDiv/StaffDiv during the previous fiscal year to positions classified in OPM’s administrative and professional occupational series (as defined in OPM’s Introduction to Position Classification Standards - PDF and their Handbook to Occupational Groups and Families - PDF), at the GS-11 level or below, via delegated examining procedures. 

Appointments made via direct hire excepted service or merit promotion authorities cannot be used to calculate annual College Graduate hiring limits.
After calculating 15% of the total number of hires made during the previous fiscal year, round up or down to the nearest whole number; i.e., values ending in .5 or more are rounded up to the nearest whole number, and values ending in less than .5 are rounded down to the nearest whole number.
OPM has the discretion to set a lower agency hiring limit during a fiscal year.  
F.  Recruitment Methods (5 U.S.C. §3327 ; 5 CFR §§315.614(e) and 316.905).

Vacancies must be advertised to the public; however, announcing via USAJOBS is not required.  USAJOBS may satisfy the public notification requirements of 5 U.S.C. §3327. Per OPM, their final regulations may exclusively require a USAJOBS posting to satisfy the requirement under 5 U.S.C. §3327 to notify OPM of competitive service vacancies (read thru line 112).

Suppose USAJOBS is not for advertising the vacancy. In that case, the job must be advertised on HHS.gov/Careers, OpDiv/StaffDiv’s public-facing home page, or at a minimum, a link to the job announcement on the employing agency’s public-facing home page.  OpDivs/StaffDivs may additionally advertise on third-party recruitment boards as long as the agency’s public-facing home page includes a link to a specific announcement.

Additionally, suppose USAJOBS is not for advertising time for the vacancy. In that case, HR Centers must provide OPM the link(s) to the public notice(s) used to solicit applicants when the links are posted, per OPM’s interim regulations.  This guidance will be updated after OPM issues final regulations and/or supplemental guidance.  HR Centers must retain sufficient documentation to provide links at a later date, if necessary, to support any hires made on/after the authority effective dates listed in this guidance.

Recruitment methods must meet the following requirements:

Provide a diverse and qualified candidate pool;
Potential applicants have information relevant to the vacancy being filled; and
Adhere to the merit system principles (5 U.S.C. §2301).
Job announcement must include:
Position title/series/grade;
Minimum qualification requirements;
Geographic location of position;
Position salary;
Eligibility for promotion/Career ladder;
For Post-Secondary students: 
If the position is temporary or term appointment;
For terms, if the appointment may be extended up to the 4-year limit (appointment extensions are not allowed without this language); and
Potential for conversion to the OpDiv/StaffDiv’s permanent workforce.
Workplace flexibilities (e.g., telework, remote work, student loan repayments); and
Information on how to apply.
CTAP and ICTAP do not apply when filling positions (5 CFR 330, Subparts F and G, Exceptions to Placement/Selection Priority); however, the HHS RPL must be cleared prior to filling positions (5 CFR 330, Subpart B).  See HHS Instruction 330-2, Priority Placement Programs, for information on the RPL.
G.  Post-Secondary Student Hiring Authority (5 U.S.C. §3116 and 5 CFR 316, Subpart I)

Temporary appointments (for initial period NTE 1 year); or
Term appointments (for an initial period expected to last more than one year but less than 4).
Initial appointments can be extended for a period that will allow the student to complete his/her degree requirements, provided the extension does not exceed the time limits in 5 CFR Part 316; the eligibility criteria (G.4.) for the appointment continues to be met, andthe job announcement included extension language described in F.4. above.

Breaks in Program (5 CFR §316.908).  OpDivs/StaffDivs may approve or deny a post-secondary employee’s request for a break in the program (i.e., a period of time when an employee is working but unable to go to school or is neither attending class nor working at HHS).  HR Centers establish internal procedures for employees to submit written requests and apply them uniformly to all employees appointed under this authority.
Conversion (5 CFR 315, Subpart G, and §316.910).  Employees may be converted to a permanent appointment in the competitive service within their employing OpDiv/StaffDiv, without further competition when the student has completed a baccalaureate or graduate degree andmeets the OPM qualification requirements for the permanent position.
Termination (5 CFR §316.912).  Employees are terminated upon the NTE date of the post-secondary student appointment unless the employee is converted to a permanent position in the competitive service, or the HR Center extends the appointment prior to expiration.  See G.1. above for appointment time limits.

Employees whose initial appointment is NTE 1 year are Tenure Group 0.
Employees whose initial appointment is expected to last more than one year are Tenure Group III.
Employees become a career or career-conditional employee only upon completion of the student’s academic requirements and non-competitive conversion to a permanent position unless the employee has already satisfied the requirements for career tenure in a previous position or is exempt from the service requirements in 5 CFR §315.201.
Acquisition of Competitive Status (5 CFR §§315.201(b)(1)(xvii) and 316.906).  Employees acquire competitive status after non-competitive conversion to a permanent appointment and upon completion of an initial probationary period.  See HHS Instruction 315-1, Probationary and Trial Periods.
