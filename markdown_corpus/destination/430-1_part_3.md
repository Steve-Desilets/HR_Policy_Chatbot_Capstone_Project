Rating of Record:  The overall summary rating for all of the critical elements in an employee’s PMAP, which is provided at the end of the appraisal cycle provided that the employee has completed the minimum period of performance as required for a rating.
Rating Official:  The Rating Official is typically the employee’s immediate supervisor.  However, a Rating Official can be any delegated official who is in a supervisory or managerial position with oversight or responsibility for the day-to-day supervision of that employee.
Reviewing Official:  The Reviewing Official has review and approval authority above the Rating Official and is ordinarily two supervisory levels above the employee.
Summary Rating:  The term used to describe the employee’s overall performance level.  The summary rating averages each individual critical element and may be “Achieved Outstanding Results (AO)”, “Achieved More Than Expected Results (AM)”, Achieved Expected Results (AE)”, “Partially Achieved Expected Results (PA)”, “Achieved Unsatisfactory Results (UR)”, or “Not Rated (NR).”
Within Grade Increase:  An increase in an employee's rate of basic pay from one step of the grade of their position to the next step of that grade.  This is granted when the employee has met the waiting period and has received at least an “Achieved Expected Results (AE)” level of performance on their most recent Rating of Record.
