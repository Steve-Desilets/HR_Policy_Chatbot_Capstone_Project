The Department’s Employee Performance Plan template includes three categories of critical elements: (1) Customer Experience; (2) Leadership; and (3) Individual Performance Outcomes the latter of which describes organization-specific individual management and program outcomes that will contribute to the success of the OpDivs/StaffDivs and the Department’s strategic mission goals and objectives. These elements describe the work assignments and job responsibilities for which each employee is individually accountable. All three, the Customer Experience, Leadership and each of the elements in the Individual Performance Outcomes are assessed as critical performance elements. The Customer Experience Element applies to all staff and the Leadership Element only applies to Supervisors, Managers and Non-bargaining Team Leaders.

Non-supervisory employees must have a minimum of two (2), but no more than six (6) critical elements. These must include:

Customer Experience Element and at least one (1) Individual Performance Outcomes Element.

Supervisory employees must have a minimum of three (3) but no more than six (6) critical elements. These must include:

Leadership Element, Customer Experience Element and at least one (1) Individual Performance Outcomes Element.

For most employees, this means that critical elements cannot describe a group’s performance. However, a supervisor or manager can and should be held accountable for seeing that results measured at the group or team level are achieved. Critical elements assessing group performance may be appropriate to include in the performance plan for a supervisor, manager, or team leader who can reasonably be expected to command the production and resources necessary to achieve the results—that is, held individually accountable.

Supervisors and managers may use several documents and/or sources to assist them in determining the appropriate critical performance elements for their employees. These include but are not limited to:

Goals and objectives outlined in the Department’s Strategic Plan.
Specific performance goals established for a given program area as outlined in the Department’s annual performance plan.
OpDiv/StaffDiv specific program goals and objectives.
Functional area/organizational goals and objectives.
Employee Position Description.
Laws and/or regulatory requirements.
Customer/stakeholder feedback.
Employee input.

Individual Performance Outcomes Elements
This category identifies the key individual performance outcomes and specific end-results that are critical to the success of the Department and the OpDivs/StaffDivs. These results-oriented outcomes should be consistent with strategic planning initiatives, such as the Department’s Strategic Plan and OpDiv/StaffDiv program goals and objectives and must include one or more outcomes that are linked to the strategic mission and/or GPRA goals of the Department, OpDiv/StaffDiv, and/or the work unit.
