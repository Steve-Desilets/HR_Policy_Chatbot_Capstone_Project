Superior Qualifications and Special Needs to Support an Advanced Rate of Pay at Initial Appointment. Consistent with 5 C.F.R. § 531.212 and HHS Instruction 531-1, Setting Pay Based on Superior Qualifications and Special Needs, at the discretion of the General Counsel (or delegate), a candidate may be offered an advanced rate of pay beyond step 1, if the General Counsel (or delegate) determines the candidate has superior qualifications or skills directly related to the position being filled or based on organizational need, as described below. Such qualifications must be significantly higher than needed to be considered minimally qualified for the position (see Table above) and/or be of a more specialized quality compared to other candidates, in accordance with 5 CFR 531.212(b)(1)). OpDiv/StaffDiv HR Centers are the final approving authority.
Experience in legal practice in a field related to the position for which the candidate is being considered (e.g., litigation, contracts, health care reimbursement, food and drug law, federal or state advocacy experience);
Significant non-legal work experience in a field related to the position for which the candidate is being considered (e.g., working with a Federal Acquisition Regulation, health care, tribal negotiations, or Equal Employment Opportunity regulations or leading complex quasi-legal investigations, or other work experience directly applicable to the work of the position for which the attorney is being hired);
Outstanding academic experience and achievement, to include a combination of awards, recognitions and honors bestowed by an academic institution; participation in clinical program with limited practice of law (typically in third year) or community service legal clinic; participation in moot court and/or other similar competitions (e.g., negotiation, mock trial, client counseling, appellate advocacy, writing) and/or completion of specialized Certificate/Curriculum programs designed to build and enhance critical professional legal skills (such as Pathways to Success Professionalism, Heath Law and Policy, Indian Law, Trial Advocacy);
Success of recent efforts to recruit candidates for the same or similar positions; recent turnover in the same or similar positions; desirability of the geographic location, duties, and/or work environment associated with the position; the importance/criticality of the position to be filled and the effect on the agency if it is not filled or if there is a delay in filling it; or other factors affecting ability to successfully recruit and/or retain candidates for the position;
Significant disparities between Federal and non-Federal salaries for the skills and competencies required in the position to be filled; or existing labor market conditions and employment trends, including the availability and quality of candidates for the same or similar positions; and/or
OGC workforce needs, as documented in OGC’s strategic human capital plan.
Managers who wish to recommend a candidate for a step level above step 1, must include the recommended step in the initial written hiring recommendation to the General Counsel (or delegate). The recommendation should specifically address the factors above as they relate to the candidate and the office’s recruitment efforts, and reasons why pay should be set above the minimum rate of pay (step), instead of/in addition to a recruitment incentive (5 CFR 531.212(d). If approved, the manager should work with the OGC Office of Legal Resources (OLR) regarding any additional procedures required.
