Frequently, when performance management is mentioned, people think of the employee performance appraisal or review. Performance management, however, involves much more. Properly constructed appraisals should represent a summary of an ongoing and year-long dialogue. An effective performance management process enables managers to evaluate and measure individual performance and optimize productivity by:

Aligning individual employee's day-to-day job responsibilities with strategic business objectives.
Providing visibility and clarifying accountability related to performance expectations.
Documenting individual performance to support compensation and career planning decisions.
Establishing focus for skill development and learning opportunities.
Creating documentation for Departmental purposes to support decisions and reduce disputes.
Many of the practices that support performance also positively impact job satisfaction, employee retention, and engagement; as well as trust and loyalty. Performance management practices include:

Delivering regular relevant job feedback.
Setting and communicating clear performance expectations.
Clearly linking performance to compensation.
Evaluating performance and delivering incentives in a fair and consistent manner.
Providing appropriate learning and development opportunities.
Recognizing and rewarding top performers.
Employees want to feel successful, to do well at their job, and feel they are making a valuable contribution. To ensure this happens, employees need a clear understanding of individual goals and how they fit into the larger organization. When effectively implemented, the best practices of performance management result in a wide range of benefits and successes for employees, managers, and the overall organization in the following ways:

Organizational Benefits of Effective Performance Management
Savings	Time Savings	Clarification of Expectations
Retention	Reduced Conflicts	Improved Self-assessment
Performance	Visible Accountability	Improved Performance
Productivity	Efficiency	Job Satisfaction
The Department is taking steps to implement innovative solutions that ensure processes deliver real results and improve performance. The purpose of this handbook is to provide concrete guidelines and practical steps that can be used to facilitate improvements to the Department’s performance management processes.

Planning
In an effective organization, work is planned in advance. This includes setting performance expectations and goals for individuals to channel efforts toward achieving organizational objectives. Involving employees in the planning process is essential to their understanding of the goals of the organization and expectations, what needs to be done and why for accomplishing those goals.

Developing Performance Plans
The regulatory requirements in 5 CFR 430 for defining an employee’s performance expectations include establishing elements and standards in an employee-specific performance plan. The employee’s performance plan outlines the specific critical job elements for which the employee will be held individually accountable during the rating cycle and that must be successfully completed for the organization to satisfactorily carry out its mission and the standards against which the employee’s performance will be measured; i.e., how well the employee must perform on each element to be appraised at a specific level. Performance elements and standards should be linked to strategic organizational goals, and be results-focused, measurable, understandable, verifiable, equitable, achievable, and provide for meaningful distinctions between levels of performance. In addition, an employee performance plan should be flexible so that it can be adjusted, as necessary, to reflect changing program objectives and work requirements. When used effectively, performance plans can be beneficial working documents that support frequent progress discussions between employee and supervisor; not merely paperwork that is filed and seen only when ratings of record are required.

A technique for establishing a performance plan is to use the “SMART” approach:

Specific: Goals and expectations are specific and clearly defined.
Measurable: Outcomes are evaluated against quantifiable standards.
Attainable: Goals or results/outcomes are achievable and realistic.
Relevant: Goals are results-based and advance the operational and strategic mission objectives of the organization.
Timely: Goals are time-bound and results are measured in terms of deadlines, due dates, schedules, or cycles.
Employee Performance Plan: HHS Form 704B
A critical element is an assignment or responsibility of such importance that unsatisfactory performance in that element alone would result in a determination that the employee’s overall performance is unsatisfactory. As defined by regulation, failure on one or more critical elements can result in the employee’s reassignment, removal, or change to a lower grade. Consequently, critical elements must describe work assignments and responsibilities that are significantly influenced by an employee’s work effort and within the employee’s control.
