531-4-2O  USE OR NONUSE OF FORMS

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) forms used to record WIGIS (Level of Competence Certification) and QSIS (DHHS Recommendation for Quality Increases) may continue to be used, OPDIVs may elect to use comparable forms, or OPDIVs may determine that there is no need for forms. Even if forms are not used, OPDIVs must have procedures in place to ensure that all requirements for WIGIS and QSIS are met. If OPDIVs want the system to generate the WIGI forms, they must continue to use the DHHS form.
