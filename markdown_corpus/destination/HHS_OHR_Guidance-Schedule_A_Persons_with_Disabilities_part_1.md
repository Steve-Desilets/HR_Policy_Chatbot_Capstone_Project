E. Procedures
Verifying Proof of Disability Prior to Appointment
In general, the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not allow an employer to ask questions about a disability until after the employer makes a conditional job offer; however, an employer may invite applicants to voluntarily self-identify as a person with a disability. Applicants who identify themselves as ‘Schedule A’ when applying to federal positions are self-identifying themselves as an individual with a disability, in accordance with the USAJOBS’ hiring paths.
To be eligible for an appointment under this Schedule A authority, the applicant must have a disability that meets the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Rehab Act”) definition of a disability and must submit proof of their disability prior to appointment. The Self-Identification of Disability Form, OPM Standard Form (SF) 256, lists disabilities that meet the Rehab Act’s definition of a disability; however, this list is not exhaustive and an individual may be eligible for an appointment even though he/she has a disability that is not on the SF-256 list, if he/she meets the requirements of 5 CFR §213.3102(u).
Prior to making a tentative job offer, the OpDiv/StaffDiv (e.g., Special Placement Program Coordinator (SPPC), servicing HR Specialist, etc.) must verify the authenticity of medical documentation from a medical professional described in 5 CFR §213.3102(u)(3)(ii) by contacting the medical professional. Contact information should be verified/obtained independently (via online, telephone directory, etc.) to ensure the request is received by the medical professional listed on the documentation. The medical provider’s confirmation that the proof of disability provided by the applicant is authentic must be in writing and documented in the case file.
