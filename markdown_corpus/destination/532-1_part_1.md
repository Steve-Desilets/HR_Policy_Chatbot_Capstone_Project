532-1-00 	PURPOSE 

This Instruction promulgates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) pay setting policy for employees covered by the Federal Wage System (FWS).  The FWS is a uniform pay-setting system applicable to Federal appropriated and non-appropriated fund blue-collar or wage grade employees paid by the hour.   

The FWS establishes pay rates for employees whose pay is fixed and adjusted periodically in accordance with the prevailing wage rates in local wage areas.  This pay system covers Federal trades, crafts, laborers, and other blue-collar or wage grade jobs. 

The Department is responsible for ensuring prevailing rates of pay, established during the wage survey process, are applied to prevailing rate employees in accordance with this Instruction and OPM requirements.  Prevailing rates of pay will be established for each wage area in which the Department has employees.  In accordance with existing statute, the wage survey process must involve the participation of labor organizations representing prevailing rate employees.
