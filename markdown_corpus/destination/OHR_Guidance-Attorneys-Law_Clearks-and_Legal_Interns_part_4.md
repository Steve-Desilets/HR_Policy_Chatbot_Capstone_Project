G. Approval Process for Newly Established Attorney Positions
Concurrence from OGC is required for the establishment of Attorney (0905) positions at any grade level, both within and outside of OGC.
When requesting establishment of a new Attorney (0905) position at any grade level:
The OpDiv/StaffDiv HR Centers review requests to establish a new Attorney (0905) position within their division. The request must include a position description (PD).
In the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Office of Chief Counsel reports to the OGC’s Food and Drug Division and seeks approval directly from the OGC. However, all other FDA Centers/Offices outside the OGC’s Food and Drug Division must obtain written approval following the steps outlined in this guidance.
If the position meets the criteria for an Attorney (General Attorney (0905) series definition - PDF), the HR Center submits the following information to ASA OHR at employmentpolicy@hhs.gov:
Signed cover memorandum from HR Director endorsing the request and requesting OGC’s review and approval;
Justification that describes the need for the position; and
PD signed by the requesting authority.
ASA OHR reviews and submits the information outlined above to OGC for concurrence, as required by HHS Instruction 511-1, Position Classification.
OGC reviews the request and concurs or denies the request with a written explanation within 30 calendar days.
OGC returns the approved or denied request to ASA OHR at employmentpolicy@hhs.gov for record keeping purposes. ASA OHR notifies requesting HR Center.
All documentation, including OGC concurrence must be attached to the PD and maintained with the HR Center for future reference as long as the position remains active.
If an approved position is vacated and the PD and organization remains the same, the OpDiv/StaffDiv has the authority to backfill the position without additional approval.
H. Recruitment
Hiring Authorities.
Attorney and Law Clerk positions are Schedule A excepted service positions appointed under 5 CFR §213.3101(d) and (e) respectively.
Legal Intern NTE (Temporary) positions are Schedule D excepted service positions appointed under 5 CFR §213.3402(a)), Pathways Programs.
Law Clerk positions are filled by HR Centers in accordance with the excepted service hiring procedures outlined in 5 CFR Part 302, and HHS Instruction 302-1, Employment in the Excepted Service.
Legal Intern NTE (Temporary) positions are filled by HR Centers in accordance with 5 CFR Part 362, and HHS Instruction 362-1, Pathways Programs.
Attorney positions are exempt from the excepted service hiring procedures under 5 CFR Part 302; but are not exempt from the merit system principles (5 U.S.C. §2301) or the regulatory requirements under 5 CFR §302.101(c):
Recruitment. (5 U.S.C. §2301 and Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures ). Recruitment methods must be used that attract a qualified applicant pool and notify potential applicants of Attorney vacancies to ensure fair and open competition. Notification options include, but are not limited to, notice on the HHS or division’s website; notices provided at job fairs; third party recruitment boards; or a traditional job opportunity announcement (JOA). Strategic outreach that includes legal- related publications and organizations may also be considered. Job notices must include information on the vacant position including salary; duties; geographic location; qualification requirements; and information on how to apply. HR Centers must establish written procedures for recruiting and assessing Attorney positions and apply these procedures uniformly to all applicants.
Veterans’ Preference.
Veteran’s preference is required to be applied as far as administratively feasible when filling Attorney positions (5 CFR §302.101(c)), i.e. military service is a positive factor when assessing Attorney candidates. Applicant lists will annotate which applicants are veterans. (For definition of administratively feasible, see OPM Vet Guide, Veterans’ Preference in Appointments, Excepted Service Employment.)
When a non-preference eligible applicant is selected over a preference eligible applicant, the pass over procedures under 5 U.S.C. §3318 are not required to be followed for Attorney positions (Jarrad vs. DOJ, 669 F.3d 1320 (9th Cir. 2012)).
Qualified Attorney applicants who are preference eligibles must be provided the reason(s) for non-selection upon request, as required by 5 CFR §302.101(c).
HHS Priority Reemployment List (PRL). Selection priority is required by regulation to be provided to former HHS excepted service employees who are registered on HHS Priority Reemployment List (PRL) before referring the names of other qualified Attorney candidates, in accordance with 5 CFR §302.101(c) and HHS Instruction 330-2, Priority Placement Programs. Sufficient documentation must be retained to demonstrate PRL clearance for each vacancy.

HR Centers do not need to provide selection priority to displaced or surplus candidates under the Career Transitions Assistance Plan (CTAP), Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan (ICTAP) or the Reemployment Priority List (RPL) before making Attorney appointments (5 CFR §§ 330.211(i) (RPL), 330.609(i) (CTAP), and 330.707(g) (ICTAP)). Note: the PRL and the RPL are two different lists. PRL covers excepted service positions and the RPL covers competitive service positions.
When processing personnel actions, OPM’s Guide to Processing Personnel Actions, Chapter 11, Excepted Service Appointments, is used, citing the specific Schedule A or Schedule D authority that authorizes the appointment.
Tenure is assigned following guidance in OPM’s Guide to Data Standards. Generally, time-limited appointments are Tenure Code 3; individuals serving trial periods are assigned Tenure Code 2; and employees who have completed trial periods and are on permanent appointments are Tenure Code 1.
