HHS Anti-Harrassment Procedure 
HHS Anti‐Harassment Policy and Procedures

I. Introduction:
The Department of Health and Human Services (the “Department” or “HHS”) and its Operating 
and  Staff  Divisions  (“Agency”  or  “Agencies”)  have  an  affirmative  obligation  to  create  and 
maintain a work environment in which employees are  treated with  dignity and respect.   The
environment  must  be  one  of  mutual  trust  and  the  absence  of  intimidation,  bullying  and 
harassment.  In  addition,  the  Secretary’s  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  (EEO)  Policy
incorporates the value of a diverse workforce, the expectation of a safe and secure workplace
free from harassment or fear of reprisal.  Therefore, the Department will not tolerate unlawful 
discrimination or harassment of any kind.  Through enforcement of this policy, the Department 
seeks  to  prevent,  correct  and,  where  it  exists,  eliminate  unacceptable  behavior  that  is 
inconsistent with this policy.
This policy covers all Department and Agency employees, regardless of position.  As such, each
is expected to comply with  this policy and  to  take appropriate measures  to ensure  that he or 
she  does  not  engage  in  the  prohibited  conduct.  Management  will take  appropriate  action 
against any employee who violates this policy.  Appropriate action includes verbal and written 
counseling,  reprimands,  suspensions,  demotion  or  removal  from  one’s  position and  from  the 
Federal Service.   
II. Policy:
In compliance with all applicable federal and state anti‐discrimination and anti‐harassment laws 
and regulations, the Department and its Agencies will enforce this policy in accordance with the 
following definitions, guidelines and procedures: 
Filing  a  complaint  under  these  procedures  is  not  equivalent  to  filing  an  EEO  complaint  of 
discrimination,  under  29  CFR  1614,  or  a  grievance,  under  the  administrative  or  negotiated
procedures noted in the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), if any.1
A. Workplace Harassment:
For purposes of  this policy, workplace harassment is defined as any verbal or physical
conduct2 that intimidates or coerces an employee, co‐worker or any person working for
or  on  behalf  of  the  Department.  Verbal  attacks  (including  racial  and  ethnic  slurs  or
derogatory  remarks),  that,  impairs his  or  her  ability  to  perform his or  her  job  are
included in the definition of harassment.
Harassment  of  any  kind,  including  sexual  harassment,  is  prohibited.  Immediate  and 
appropriate  action  will  be  taken  against  any  Department  employee  found  to be  in 
violation of  this policy.  To be unlawful, the conduct must be so severe or repeated or 
pervasive such  that it  creates  a  work environment that  is hostile,  intimidating  or 
offensive to a reasonable person.  For the purpose of these procedures, the “reasonable 
person” standard considers the complainant’s perspective and assesses if a reasonable 
person  exposed  to  the  same  or  similar  circumstances  would  find  the  environment
hostile, intimidating, or offensive.3
B. Definitions:
(1) Workplace harassment is considered to have occurred when: 
(i)	 The  conduct  was  sufficiently  severe  or  pervasive  (e.g.,  a pattern)  enough  to 
create an  environment  that  is  hostile,  or  intimidating  to  a reasonable  person 
exposed to the same or similar circumstances.4
(2) Inappropriate conduct occurs when the complainant has not solicited or invited the 
conduct  and  regards  it  as  unacceptable,  (outside  of work  assignments  or 
instructions) and the complainant is not an active participant in the behavior. Note: 
submission does not mean the conduct was welcomed.  Examples include:
Sexual  advances/pressures  for  dates.  (Violator  must  be  told  that  behavior  is 
unacceptable, or unwelcomed) 
Inappropriate or racial slurs, comments, and innuendos. 
Rude or obnoxious remarks or comments. 
Inappropriate touching. 
Inappropriate gestures, expressions, pictures or graffiti. 
Threats made against others or other threatening behavior. 
Inappropriate communication such as slurs, epithets, ridicule, insults, displaying 
objects,  pictures, graffiti, etc.   This type  of inappropriate communication could 
happen  in  person,  on  the  phone,  through  other  electronic  means  of 
communication, etc. 
(3) Liability attaches if (i) the Department or Agency management knew or should have 
known of the harassment and (ii) failed to take immediate and appropriate action to
investigate the behavior.  Knowledge is assumed if:
The victim complains about harassment to the appropriate official;      
The conduct occurred in the presence of a manager or supervisor and they    were
aware of it; 
The conduct is widespread; or
The complainant put the alleged violator on notice.

III. Roles and Responsibilities:
A. Employee Complainants:
Timely  report incidents of  workplace  harassment to  any  appropriate  HHS 
manager or supervisor.  In cases where the employee’s supervisor, or someone
within the employee’s chain of command, is the offender, employees may file a
complaint with any management official who is outside of the employee’s chain 
of command, if necessary. 
Cooperate fully with management’s investigation of the complaint. 
Report  any  acts of  retaliation  related  to making  a  good  faith  report  of 
harassment, or for assisting with an investigation. 
Be aware that management cannot guarantee confidentiality or anonymity when
investigating a workplace harassment complaint.  Management may be required 
to  inform  those  with  a need‐to‐know  the  details  surrounding  the  workplace
harassment  complaint  or  the  questioning  of  witnesses  may  not  maintain 
confidentiality. 
Take advantage of  the Employee Assistance Program  (EAP) counseling services, 
or  other  personal  counseling  services,  when  necessary,  to  address  personal 
problems relating to the workplace harassment. 
Request  special  accommodations  from  management.  (e.g.,  temporary  parking, 
etc.). 
B. Agency Managers and Supervisors:
Inform  employees  about  policies  and  procedures  for  handling  incidents  of 
workplace harassment. 
Treat all reports of workplace harassment seriously and respond appropriately.

                                                            
HHS Anti‐Harassment Policy and Procedures

Consult  with  a Labor  and  Employee  Relations  (LER)  Specialist  immediately 
regarding  allegations  of  workplace  harassment, irrespective  of  whether  or  not
complainant elects to file a formal complaint.   
Where  required,  timely  investigate  the  alleged  harassment;  documenting  the
investigative findings; taking appropriate action, including disciplinary action, to 
remedy the situation; and, making a good faith effort to prevent future incidents 
from occurring. 
Take  steps  to  prevent  retaliation  against  complainants  who  allege  workplace 
harassment or those who are involved in management inquiries. 
C. Employee Relations:
Advise, guide, and assist supervisors and managers with investigating allegations 
of workplace harassment. 
Recommend solutions, actions and/or discipline, and interim relief for individuals 
alleging workplace harassment. 
Advise managers and  supervisors on  the provisions of  the  collective bargaining
agreement and  other  applicable  laws,  rules,  regulations,  policies,  and 
procedures.
IV. Procedures for Reporting & Adjudicating Violations:
Agency  management  will  handle  all  complaints  submitted  under  this  policy  swiftly  and 
confidentially to the extent possible based on staffing.  Also, lodging a complaint will in no way
be  used  against  the  complainant  or  have  an  impact  on  the  individual’s  employment  status.  
However,  filing  groundless  or  malicious  complaints,  as  determined  by  the  investigator(s),  is
deemed an abuse of  this policy and, thus, will be  treated as a violation. Employees must  still 
maintain acceptable workplace behavior.  
(1) In accordance with  the policies noted under  the Roles and Responsibilities, employees
may file a complaint with any appropriate Agency management official if the violator is 
in the chain of command.
(2) Agency  management  officials,  in  consultation  with  LER,  will  make  a  determination 
regarding whether an official investigation is warranted.6
If yes, determine  scope and  select  the investigative lead.  (Investigators will  follow 
procedures outlined  in  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  for  bargaining  unit 
employees.) 
If no, determine the appropriate action to take and execute.   
(3) Investigator(s)  will  prepare  a  written  report  of  the  findings,  and  submit  it  to  the
6
  Investigation leads may include manager(s), supervisor(s), the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a
contract investigator or other qualified individuals.  (Note ‐ The particulars of each case will influence who will 
lead the investigation.)
