Goals of the IDP
The employee and the rating official develop IDP goals together. The IDP provides a connection between the employee’s career interests and needs to the organizational mission and priorities. The most common goals of an IDP are to:

Learn new skills to improve current job performance.
Maximize current performance in support of organizational requirements.
Increase interest, challenge, and satisfaction in current position.
Obtain knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for career growth.
An IDP identifies a broad spectrum of developmental opportunities for the employee, including on- the-job training, distance learning, formal classroom training, details, shadow assignments and self- development. It addresses the needs of the organization and of the employee beginning with a focus on maximizing employee performance in the current job.

An IDP is a guide to help individuals reach career goals within the context of organizational objectives. It is a developmental action plan to move employees from their current place to where they want to go. It provides the systematic steps to improve and to build on strengths as individuals improve job performance and pursue career goals.

An IDP is a partnership between the employee and the rating official for employee development. Preparing an IDP involves open feedback, clarification, and discussion about developmental needs, goals, and plans. Periodic communication between the rating official and the employee is the key to the success of an IDP.

An IDP is not a:

Performance appraisal. It is not used to determine pay, awards, or other personnel actions based on performance.
Contract for training. Final approval of training opportunities is made based on factors such as timing and budget availability.
Position Description. It is not used for clarifying discrepancies in the duties as described.
Guarantee for promotion or for reassignment to another position. While the developmental experiences identified in an IDP may have some training that might qualify the employee for another position or grade, there is no guarantee of advancement.
One means to establish an IDP is by using the following Assessment, Discussion, and Implementation approach:

Assessment: The employee reviews prior job experience, training, education, and other developmental experiences to provide concrete information regarding current strengths and skills. This could include a review of past applications for employment and past training records. The employee reviews the established performance standards to determine core competencies, skills, and learning opportunities necessary for the job.  The employee assesses personal career goals, within the context of established performance requirements and organizational needs, and constructs both an immediate and a longer-term plan to achieve his/her learning goals. The employee may seek guidance from peers, current and past supervisors, or HHS University. The supervisor should ensure the employee knows that he/she is available for assistance and support.
Discussion: The employee and supervisor should mutually agree to discuss the results of the assessment and reach consensus on the draft IDP prepared by the employee. The discussion should review and assess the plan within the context of organizational needs, the employee’s current and prospective job requirements, the employee’s strengths and developmental needs, financial limitations, timing, and learning opportunities that the supervisor is able to actively support.  The supervisor coaches the employee by providing candid and constructive feedback, identifying challenging assignments, discussing potential career paths in the organization, and reasonable timeframes for meeting the objectives of the IDP. The supervisor and employee should sign a completed IDP.
Implementation: The supervisor ensures that any necessary procurement or training request forms are prepared and monitors work that is assigned to best accomplish the IDP’s developmental objectives. The employee reports on completion of items in the IDP. The supervisor and the employee meet periodically throughout the year to review and update the IDP.
As in all aspects of the employee/supervisor relationship, direct and open communications are the keys to a successful IDP. The following describe the respective responsibilities of the employee and supervisor in the IDP process:
