F.  Procedures.

Occupational questionnaires generally ask candidates to self-report their level of training and experience in carrying out critical tasks and demonstrating critical competencies identified through job analysis. In order to increase the quality of applicants for selection consideration, Executive Order 13932 mandates additional applicant assessment tools other than self-report occupational questionnaires. OpDivs/StaffDivs should use effective assessment tools in determining what candidates for a position will be placed on the Certificate of Eligibles for a position.

Choosing Effective Assessment Tools
Using effective assessment tools will reduce the degree of error in making hiring decisions. Well-developed assessment tools allow OpDivs/StaffDivs to specifically target the competencies and skills they seek. This helps to ensure the time spent by both applicants and agency personnel adds value to the decision-making process.

Any assessment tool must be reliable, valid, relevant and meet the following criteria:

Fair and practical – Assessment procedures must be practical and provide candidates a fair chance to have their job-related abilities evaluated.
Best qualified candidates – Assessment procedures should be successful in identifying a highly qualified, diverse pool of candidates who can perform successfully in the position.
Develop and use without discrimination. Candidates should not be discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, or political affiliation.
Provide candidates with the opportunity to appeal – A candidate may file a complaint with an agency when he or she believes that an employment practice that was applied to him or her and that is administered by the agency discriminates against him or her on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as defined by the Age Discrimination in Employment  Act of 1967,  as amended), disability, and genetic information (including family medical history). See 5 CFR § 300.103  and 5 CFR § 300.104. 
The assessment tool used will vary depending on the type of position being filled, the competencies identified for that position, the volume of applicants anticipated and the resources available (e.g., time, budget, and subject matter expertise). Self-report questionnaires can still be used in conjunction with another assessment tool that measures job-related competencies, without relying solely on self-report ratings.

Establishment of Talent Teams
Creation of talent teams is vital to the success of multi-hurdle applicant assessment processes. OpDivs/StaffDivs may create talent teams consistent with their individual recruitment needs.

Creating talent teams supports OpDivs/StaffDivs and their teams with a multi-level effort, including initiatives such as improvements for applicants, hiring managers, and HR using new and existing best practices. Therefore, OpDivs/StaffDivs are encouraged to create talent teams and set aside funds for assessment tools.
The ideal talent team should consist of a combination of new and existing highly talented individuals with strong leadership skills and a working knowledge of HHS HR policy and their OpDiv/StaffDiv operational practices and internal procedures. This must include HR staff with measurement expertise or I/O psychologists to help facilitate and validate custom technical and behavioral assessments, based on job analysis results.
The duties and functions of the talent team may include the following:
Continuously use hiring selection outcome data to inform assessment strategy for critical positions posted to the public.
Help execute strategically identified hiring assessment pilots using existing or new approaches and flexibilities, SME-QA panels, structured interviews, USA Hire, etc.
Drive new strategies and adoption of successful practices, including pooled hiring actions, effective qualifying technical and behavioral assessments, and shared certificate platforms.
Identify and implement tools to automate segments of the assessment process.
Serve as the connection point with the Hiring Line of Business and other OpDiv/StaffDiv talent teams to share best practices, joint job announcements, and government-wide implementation challenges.
Continuously analyze results of actions to measure potential adverse impact, determine applicant perception of assessments used, and work with SMEs to collaborate on assessment materials (including doing retrospectives).
Put the applicant experience at the forefront, to ensure that OpDivs/StaffDivs can attract top talent by reducing overly burdensome hurdles and processes.
Development of Assessment Tools
If a talent team is utilized, it will be responsible for the development and implementation of multi- hurdle (two or more) assessment tools for the screening of candidates, prior to certificate placement and referral, during the assessment process. All assessment tools must consider the following factors: (1) reliability, (2) validity, (3) technology, (4) legal context, and (5) face validity/applicant reactions.
