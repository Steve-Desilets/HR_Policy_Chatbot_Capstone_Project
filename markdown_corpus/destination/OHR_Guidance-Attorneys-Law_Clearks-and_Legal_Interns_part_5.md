I. Trial Periods
HHS excepted service employees serve a two (2) year trial period. Rules on initial trial periods; supervisor and manager trial periods; creditable time; failure to complete a trial period; and performance based and adverse actions taken during trial periods are covered in HHS Instruction 315-1 Probationary and Trial Periods.

J. Other Actions
Details are made in accordance with the rules under 5 CFR §300.301  and HHS Instruction 300-3, Details and IPA Assignments.
Employees reassigned to another position without promotion or change to a lower grade must meet the qualification requirements for the position (series/grade level). Consult the HHS Instruction 362-1, Pathways Programs for additional reassignment rules for Legal Interns.
Promotions (5 U.S.C. §§2301 and 2302).
The merit system principles apply to promotion/advancement within the excepted service; therefore, the employee must compete/have competed for the proposed position/grade level(s).
Promotions within the excepted service are not subject to the time-in-grade restrictions outlined in 5 CFR Part 300, Subpart F ; however, employees must meet the qualification requirements for the position (series and grade).
Time-in-grade restrictions outlined in 5 CFR Part 300, Subpart F, apply to movement to or within the competitive service; therefore, while promotions within the excepted service are not subject to time-in-grade; promotions upon non-competitive conversion to the competitive service (i.e., Legal Interns covered by this guidance) are subject to time-in-grade restrictions.
The time-limits for temporary, time-limited, intermittent, and seasonal Attorney appointments are described under 5 CFR §213.104. (Appointment time-limits for Law Clerks and Legal Interns are covered in this guidance under Section E., Definitions.)
K. Adverse Actions and Appeals
Excepted service employees who meet the definition of ‘employee’ under 5 U.S.C. § 7511(a) (1)(B-C) generally have appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board for adverse actions.
Servicing Employee Relations staff should be consulted when dealing with unacceptable performance and/or employee misconduct to ensure actions are in compliance with law, regulations, HHS policy, and applicable collective bargaining agreement(s).
Individuals entitled to priority consideration who are preference eligibles, or suffered compensable injury, have appeal rights to the MSPB if they believe their reemployment rights were violated (5 CFR §§302.101(c); 302.103; and 302.501).
L. Documentation and Accountability
Records associated with personnel actions, including all documentation sufficient for third party reconstruction purposes, must be retained according to the record disposition schedule. Generally, all records created in a given year must be retained for a total of three (3) full years. Records involved in litigation and grievance processes may be destroyed only after official notification is received from OPM, Department of Justice, Courts, the Office of General Counsel etc. that the matter has been fully litigated, or resolved, and closed.
ASA OHR may conduct periodic accountability reviews to analyze compliance with this guidance, HHS and OPM policy and guidance, and all applicable federal laws and regulations.
