315-1-00 Purpose
This Instruction implements the Department of Health and Human Services (Department or HHS) policy, responsibilities, and procedures on Reduction in Force (RIF).  Separating or downgrading employee(s) due to reorganization, lack of work, shortage of funds, insufficient personnel ceiling, or the exercise of certain reemployment or restoration rights are RIF actions.  A furlough of more than 30 calendar days (or more than 22 discontinuous work days) but not more than 1 year; and a reclassification of an employee’s position due to erosion of duties when the classification action will take effect after a RIF has been formally announced in the employee’s competitive area and when the RIF will take effect within 180 days are also RIF actions.  HHS Operating and Staff Divisions (OpDiv/StaffDiv, or Division) must use RIF as a method of last resort and ensure that all available workforce restructuring options are utilized first to minimize or avoid the adverse impact of RIF on employees.

When provisions of this policy differ from changes in applicable law or regulation, the changes in law or regulation apply.

315-1-10 Coverage and Exclusions
Coverage.
The provisions of this Instruction apply to all HHS employees in competitive and excepted service positions.

Exclusions. This Instruction does not apply to:
Members of the Senior Executive Service (SES);
An employee whose appointment is required by Congress to be confirmed by, or made with the advice and consent of, the Senate;
U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) Commissioned Corps Officers;
A reemployed annuitant, unless the appointing officer determines that an annuitant may compete under the RIF regulations (an annuitant serves at the will of the agency and may be separated at any time at the discretion of the appointing officer; however, if the agency does not separate the annuitant prior to a RIF, the agency determines the annuitant’s retention standing on the basis of the employee's actual appointment and the annuitant competes in the RIF in the same manner as other competing employees); and
The actions excluded in 5 CFR §351.202(c).
