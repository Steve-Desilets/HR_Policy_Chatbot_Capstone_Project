OHR Guidance Post-Secondary Students and College Graduates

A.  Purpose.

This guidance establishes hiring procedures and reporting requirements for two (2) new competitive service hiring authorities for 1) Post-Secondary Students and 2) College graduates.  These hiring authorities are not part of the Pathways Programs.  The 2019 National Defense Authorization Act established them, which required the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to revise regulations to allow certain positions to be filled.  

When this guidance differs from changes in applicable law or regulation, the changes in law or regulation apply.

B.  Coverage.

This guidance covers time-limited appointments via the Post-Secondary Student hiring authority  (5 CFR 316, Subpart I) and permanent appointments via the College Graduate hiring authority (5 CFR §315.614) at the GS-11 grade level (or equivalent) and below.  The specific competitive service authority must be cited in personnel actions when filling positions.

The provisions of this guidance pertaining to conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees are fully negotiable in accordance with 5 U.S.C. Chapter 71. When the provisions of this guidance differ from the requirements contained in applicable collective bargaining agreement(s), the agreement takes precedence for covered bargaining unit employees.

E.  Hiring Limits (5 CFR §§315.614(i) and 316.913)

READ CAREFULLY.  Each fiscal year, OpDivs/StaffDivs cannot exceed the hiring limits in the regulations cited above and described below: 
Post-Secondary Student Authority:  The annual hire limit is 15% of the total number of student appointments to positions at the GS-11 level or below made by OpDiv/StaffDiv during the previous fiscal year.

Student appointments made via the Pathways Intern (5 CFR §213.3402(a)) and Post-Secondary Student (5 CFR 316, Subpart I) hiring authorities may be used to calculate the annual hiring limit.

Appointments made via direct hire excepted service (except for the Pathways Intern Program), non-competitive authorities, or merit promotion cannot be used to calculate the Post-Secondary Student hiring limit. 
College Graduate Authority:  The annual hire limit is 15% of the total number of persons appointed by the OpDiv/StaffDiv during the previous fiscal year to positions classified in OPM’s administrative and professional occupational series (as defined in OPM’s Introduction to Position Classification Standards - PDF and their Handbook to Occupational Groups and Families - PDF), at the GS-11 level or below, via delegated examining procedures. 

Appointments made via direct hire excepted service or merit promotion authorities cannot be used to calculate annual College Graduate hiring limits.
After calculating 15% of the total number of hires made during the previous fiscal year, round up or down to the nearest whole number; i.e., values ending in .5 or more are rounded up to the nearest whole number, and values ending in less than .5 are rounded down to the nearest whole number.
OPM has the discretion to set a lower agency hiring limit during a fiscal year.  
F.  Recruitment Methods (5 U.S.C. §3327 ; 5 CFR §§315.614(e) and 316.905).

Vacancies must be advertised to the public; however, announcing via USAJOBS is not required.  USAJOBS may satisfy the public notification requirements of 5 U.S.C. §3327. Per OPM, their final regulations may exclusively require a USAJOBS posting to satisfy the requirement under 5 U.S.C. §3327 to notify OPM of competitive service vacancies (read thru line 112).

Suppose USAJOBS is not for advertising the vacancy. In that case, the job must be advertised on HHS.gov/Careers, OpDiv/StaffDiv’s public-facing home page, or at a minimum, a link to the job announcement on the employing agency’s public-facing home page.  OpDivs/StaffDivs may additionally advertise on third-party recruitment boards as long as the agency’s public-facing home page includes a link to a specific announcement.

Additionally, suppose USAJOBS is not for advertising time for the vacancy. In that case, HR Centers must provide OPM the link(s) to the public notice(s) used to solicit applicants when the links are posted, per OPM’s interim regulations.  This guidance will be updated after OPM issues final regulations and/or supplemental guidance.  HR Centers must retain sufficient documentation to provide links at a later date, if necessary, to support any hires made on/after the authority effective dates listed in this guidance.
