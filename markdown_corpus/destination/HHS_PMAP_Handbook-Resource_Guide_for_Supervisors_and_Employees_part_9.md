Unsatisfactory Performance Vs. Misconduct
It is important to note the distinction between performance at the Achieved Unsatisfactory Results level and employee misconduct. Sometimes, misconduct can result in poor performance. Sometimes performance and misconduct can be inter-related. However, it is important to recognize the difference between the two and to take prompt and appropriate actions accordingly.

Performance at the Achieved Unsatisfactory Results level is failure of the employee to perform the job at the required minimum retention level of Partially Achieved Expected Results. Misconduct is failure to follow a workplace rule, code, or behavior, whether written or unwritten. Examples of misconduct include tardiness, absenteeism, unprofessional or discourteous conduct, damaging or destroying government property, or falsification. A misconduct problem also may exist when an employee is capable of performing his/her duties at the Partially Achieved Expected Results level, or higher, but chooses not to. Poor performance and/or misconduct can result in disciplinary action, including removal.

Supervisor’s Checklist for Appraisals
Meeting with Employees
Giving and receiving feedback is one of the critical components of the performance appraisal process. As a rating official, you should ensure that the feedback you provide is meaningful, that you take the time to prepare, and that the employee has a chance to ask questions and provide input.

Meeting with your employees to discuss how they are doing can and should be very beneficial for both of you, enabling you both to understand each other better. The more you know one another, the greater the likelihood you will be able to effectively communicate on an ongoing basis, particularly should a problem arise.

While you are encouraged to provide feedback to your employees on an on-going basis, Department policy requires that you meet formally with employees at least once approximately midway through the performance appraisal cycle, and once at the end of the rating year. These meetings are a chance for you to engage in an open exchange with your employees about their performance.

Please be aware that these mandatory meeting requirements may be modified by the specific Collective Bargaining Agreements negotiated for your OpDiv/StaffDiv, so it is critical that you consult your designated LER representative to ensure appropriate formal compliance requirements are met.

The following are examples of the subjects that are appropriate for one-on-one progress and professional development meetings with each of your employees:

Organizational expectations, individual performance standards, and specific feedback on the work the employee did well and/or areas that need improvement.
Information about the “big picture” and how the employee’s role, responsibilities, and achievements contribute to mission/organizational goals.
Feedback from the employee about how he/she feels about his/her job, whether he/she enjoys the work and is ready for greater responsibilities, concerns about current work assignments, and requests for guidance or assistance from you or co-workers.
Professional development plans and opportunities; i.e., your employee’s career goals. These meetings can be as simple as discussing training opportunities to better handle a specific project or as broad as the employee’s long-term professional aspirations and plans (e.g., individual development plan).
Conducting Midyear Reviews
Prior to the midyear progress review, supervisors should prepare by considering the following:

Request information from the employee on his/her key work accomplishments for the period being discussed. Keep a “kudos” folder for each employee with key accomplishments that you can refer to.
If you have specific issues that you want to discuss with the employee, ensure that you are prepared to discuss the specifics of the concerns, clearly and concisely.
Think about and document what is most important regarding achievements and concerns for you to share with the employee about his/her progress and overall performance.
Write down what you feel the employee has done/accomplished/learned, what he/she did particularly well, and any areas in which you feel the employee needs to improve, including what they could have done better. You should include examples of specific projects or assignments.
Think about whether the employee has the skills you think he/she needs to do his/her job well and write down any skills you think need to be gained or improved.
Write down the key points and questions you want to discuss during the meeting.
Conducting End-of-Year Reviews
During the end-of-year review discussion, review the employee’s performance during the current performance period. Summarize key accomplishments, praise the employee for work that was completed particularly well, advise the employee of work that could have been improved and/or areas where he/she may need to focus more effort, etc. Offer examples and provide the employee an opportunity to ask clarifying questions and provide additional information. This should be a two-way dialogue, not a lecture.

In addition:

Ask the employee for feedback about the past year and for other information that you both can use in working more effectively together in the future. For example, did the employee feel appropriately supported; was the feedback the employee received, sufficient, useful, and timely; and is the employee adequately trained and does he/she have the resources needed to carry out his/her work.
Ask the employee about his/her immediate and/or long-term career goals and offer suggestions or resources to assist him/her with these goals, as appropriate.
Clearly articulate your expectations for the coming year and confirm with the employee that he/she understands the expectations. Be prepared to clarify any areas of confusion.
Once the review discussion is completed, both the manager and the employee sign the appraisal form and the employee is provided with a copy of the completed appraisal.
