Quality Step Increase (QSI)
Who can get a QSI?

A QSI is a pay feature of the General Schedule. QSIs shall only be awarded based on an employee receiving an Achieved Outstanding Results summary rating for the previous rating cycle, and not for midyear performance accomplishments. Further, a QSI may not be granted to an employee who has received a QSI within the preceding fifty (52) consecutive calendar weeks. QSIs are not automatic and are awarded at managementâ€™s discretion.

Is a written justification required to grant a QSI?

OPM strongly encourages departments to require some form of recorded justification, assuring compliance with department-established criteria for QSI eligibility. This enables a department to show that the proposed recipient has performed at a truly exceptional level to justify a permanent increase in his/her rate of basic pay.

Performance Plans
What is a critical performance element?

A critical element is a work assignment or responsibility of such importance that unacceptable performance on that element would result in a determination that the employee's overall performance is unacceptable.

What is a retention performance standard?

A retention performance standard describes the level of performance necessary to retain a position. It is the standard written for performance one level above the Achieved Unacceptable Results level. In appraisal programs where a Partially Achieved Expected Results Level exists for appraising elements, the standard for job retention is the Partially Achieved Expected Results Level.

Could someone who has responsibility for a group of employees (supervisor, manager, team leader) have a critical performance element based on a result that the group is expected to achieve?

Yes. OPM believes it is possible to develop a critical performance element and standard that holds a supervisor, manager, or team leader responsible for group performance. The element and standard would have to be crafted carefully so that it identifies measurable achievements that would be expected to result when the individual supervisor, manager, or team leader properly exercises his/her leadership responsibilities.

Should rating officials be held accountable for making meaningful distinctions in performance?

Yes. OPM encourages departments to hold supervisors accountable for fulfilling their performance management responsibilities. Departments often establish elements and standards in the performance plans of rating officials to hold them accountable for the performance management of their subordinates.

Must a department have written performance plans for its employees?

The regulations state "written, or otherwise recorded." This language was chosen very deliberately to allow for use of electronic formats. Although departments do not have to write performance plans on paper, the plans must be recorded in some way and departments must be able to produce a paper copy, if needed. Purely oral plans do not meet the regulatory requirement.

How will an employee's performance plan be different if he/she teleworks?

There is no difference between managing the performance of a teleworker and managing the employee who works in the office. Performance is grounded in what one accomplishes, not necessarily where one carries out his/her duties and responsibilities.

Are the performance rating, the rating of record, and the summary level the same thing?

No, but they are similar. A performance rating is the appraisal of the employee's performance compared to the elements and standards established in the performance plan. The rating of record is a specific performance rating done at the end of the appraisal period that includes the appraisal of the elements and standards and also must include the assignment of a summary level (Levels 1 through 5).  A summary level is an ordered category of performance from Level 1 through Level 5, with Level 1 as the lowest and Level 5 as the highest. Performance ratings assigned at times other than the end of the appraisal period, such as at the midyear review, do not require a summary level to be assigned, although one is permitted.

Can employees on approved annual or sick leave be held to a work performance standard in their performance appraisal?

A department may not hold an employee accountable for work that does not get done because of an absence for which the employee is on any type of approved leave. If there is a specific performance standard for the appraisal year, it may be pro-rated for the amount of time the employee was at work.

Must the rating of record be derived and the summary level assigned only on the basis of an appraisal of elements and standards in the employee's performance plan?

Yes. Statute requires that employees be evaluated against their performance elements and standards.


Why does OPM require higher-level management review of a Level 1 (Achieved Unsatisfactory Results) rating of record?

An Achieved Unsatisfactory Results level rating of record bars granting Step Increases, may result in a performance-based adverse action, and removes retention rights in a Reduction In Force. For these reasons, there must be an extra measure of assurance that a Level 1 rating of record has been properly assigned. The requirement for higher-level review of a rating of record that could have significant consequences for the employee, including removal, is a prudent measure of protection for the employee.

Can veterans on leave seeking treatment for a service-related disability be held to a work performance standard in their performance plan?

Performance management regulations specifically address veterans seeking medical treatment. A department may not lower the rating of record or performance rating of a disabled veteran seeking medical treatment.

Can individual critical elements be written to appraise the individual's contribution to a team?

Yes. The individual critical element must describe performance that is reasonably measured and controlled at the individual employee's level. Such performance includes individual contributions to the team, but does not include team performance.

Can a department use critical elements that address team performance?

The law intends critical elements to be used to establish individual accountability. This restriction is clearest for non-supervisory employees who may be serving as team members. Consequently, critical elements generally are not appropriate for identifying and measuring team performance, which by its definition involves shared accountability. A supervisor or manager can and should be held accountable for seeing that results measured at the group or team level are achieved. Critical elements assessing group performance may be appropriate to include in the performance plan of a supervisor, manager, or team leader who can reasonably be expected to command the resources and authority necessary to achieve the results.
