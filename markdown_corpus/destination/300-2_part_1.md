300-2-00: Purpose
This Instruction establishes a Shared Certificates Program within the Department of Health and Human Services (Department or HHS) to expedite hiring by permitting HHS Operating/Staff Divisions (OpDivs/StaftDivs) to share a Certificate of Eligibles across HHS when filling certain vacancies under Merit Promotion Procedures (MPP); Direct-Hire Authority (DHA); or when filling positions via a non-competitive  appointment, specifically transfers from another Federal agency, reinstatement, or reemployed annuitant.  (Sharing certificates under Delegated Examining with other federal agencies, 5 CFR §332.408, is not covered by this Instruction. HHS's program may be expanded in the future.)

When provisions of this policy differ from changes in applicable law or regulation, the changes in law or regulation apply.

      1. Certificates of Eligibles issued under Delegated Examining Authority (with the exception of certificates issued to fill positions  via a DHA, as described above);

      2. Certificates of Eligibles issued under Merit Promotion for a vacancy open internally to one (1) OpDiv/StaffDiv;

      3. Certificates of Eligibles issued under an HHS-specific Direct-Hire Authority approved by OPM for only one (1) OpDiv/StaftDiv;

      4. Certificates of Eligibles issued for Excepted Service vacancies; and

C.  Bargaining Unit Employees

The provisions of this Instruction pertaining to conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees (e.g., the filling of a position within the scope of the bargaining unit) are fully negotiable in accordance with 5 U.S.C.
